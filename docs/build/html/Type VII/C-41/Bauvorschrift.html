<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li><p>Proof of weight</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The weight and center of gravity of all components must be calculated
based on the drawings prior to construction and compared with the weight
stroke. The weights weighed must be constantly compared with the
estimated weights during construction. Which boats are to be weighed is
specified in the delivery instructions.</p>
<p>The installed weights shall be communicated to the building inspectorate
by group, separately, every quarter of a year in such a way that the
building inspectorate can make the quarterly reports on time.</p>
<p>The weighing books must be delivered to the O.K. M. after completion.</p>

</ol>
<p>On the basis of the proofs of weight and displacement referred to in (c)
and dispersed, the submarines to be weighed in accordance with the
delivery instructions for the assessment of the stability and the trim
and swimming position for normal and large payload shall be required
every 4 months (in addition, as soon as possible shortly before the
shipyard trim of the first submarine), to draw up predatory and priority
calculations and to submit them to the O.K.M. on 15, 3, 15, 7 and 15.As
with other major deviations from the invoice, stannnwerft must be sent
an interim invoice without being requested, as is the case with other
major deviations from the invoice.</p>
<p>After completion of the construction, the final weight, displacement,
and priority calculation must be delivered to the O.K.M. based on the
weighing book.</p>
<p>The weights weighed must be used in the weight calculations, as far as
this is possible up to the time. These groups must then be specially
identified.</p>
<p>In addition, the additional and lower weights of the individual groups
shall be entered in a special column, provided that their weight differs
from that of the main yard. The resulting stability and trim changes
must be reported.</p>
<p>The invoices are to be included for the for water and underwater
swimming pool: the weights, the displacements, the focal points for the
individual groups of the hull, the machinery and equipment, as well as
the stability for the stress cases specified in the calculation of the
main shipyard.</p>
<p>In addition, a compilation of the main information and the cell, bunker
and tank contents shall be attached and the Forwater swimming position
shall be indicated for all stress cases.</p>
<p>The calculation scales are to be produced in only 6 copies, two of which
are intended for the shipyard, the building supervision and the O.K.M.
The special confidentiality provisions must be observed.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>A3 Materials</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>General</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The materials to be used for the hull, etc., should comply with the
material standards of the Kriegsmarine. In drawings, bills of materials,
etc., the standardized short characters are generally to be used.
Non-standard special materials may only be used for fewer, important
components. Procurement and acceptance must be carried out in accordance
with the latest delivery conditions and acceptance regulations of the
Kriegsmarine.</p>
<p>Only in the case of low-stressed components of minor importance can
acceptance be dispensed with in agreement with the building supervision</p>
<p>All materials for more important components may only be purchased from
companies listed in the Navy’s supplier list.</p>
<p>The use of savings materials must be restricted as far as possible, but
this must not reduce operational safety.</p>
<p>In the case of vital components, fuels may be replaced by substitutes
only if they are equivalent in all respects and this does not affect the
safety of the submarine and the reliability of the components.</p>
<p>During the war, the war-related austerity regulations apply, which must
be observed closely.</p>
<p>All dubious cases must be resolved with the main shipyard and its
construction supervision or the O.K.M.</p>
<p>Heat treatment and the hot and cold processing of the materials must be
carried out properly, in the case of alloys or special steels only under
the conditions specified by the material manufacturer.</p>
<p>A processing of rolled materials made of flux steel in a blue-warm state
may not be carried out because of the brittleness that may occur. If
necessary, the warmly processed parts must be re-heated normally after
processing.</p>
<p>All sheets which are to be galvanized later are not to be appropriated
at the time of delivery and must not be varnished.</p>
<p>The materials for components in contact with seawater shall be chosen in
such a way as to avoid galvanic anemic eating.</p>
<p>For the processing of the printing bulkhead, see S I 7 b.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Material selection</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All components of rolled material which can be claimed in normal
operation with 12 atm corresponding to an immersive depth of 120 m, as
well as all the chippings, angles, reinforcements, and other joints
required for these components, shall be manufactured from St. 52 KM, the
weldability of which shall be demonstrated. These parts include: the
pressure body skin, the plating of the control and understatement cells
and the (inner) submersible cell 3, the final bulkhead of the
submersible cell 3 and all the slats and reinforcements required for
these components, on the other hand, the bulkheads of control and
understatement cells from St 42 KM are to be produced. Slats that are
bent cold must be made of aluminum-calmed material.</p>
<p>For the plates made of St 52 KM, the tolerance for boiler plates
according to the latest regulations of the German Kriegsmarine applies
as the thickness tolerance. The sheets should preferably not have an
undersized and must not exceed the permissible excess. If the collection
points or the sheet metal processing yards or steel construction
companies find any deviations in thickness beyond the values permitted
under the boiler plate tolerances, these shall be communicated to the
O.K.M. on presentation of a sketch of the measuring points and
indication of the shot, which decides on a case-by-case basis on the
possibility of use.</p>
<p>The weldability of all materials to be used and welded must be
demonstrated.</p>
<p>All other components, unless otherwise specified and in so far as they
are subordinate parts, shall be manufactured from St 42 KM or Thomas
steel. For the use of Thomas steel in submarine construction, see O.K.M.
disposition KIBm No. 1626/43 dated 12.5.43.</p>
<p>If different materials are to be used for individual series than those
specified here for the pressure body skin, etc., the shipyards concerned
will receive special instructions.</p>
<p>Strong flat irons, which are used for enclosing openings, such as the
slurry of the pressure-resistant manhole openings and the edge flat
irons of the pressure-resistant bulkhead, are to glow normally before
welding in. See S I 7b</p>
<p>Insofar as steel casting is required, stg 45-81 BK is generally required
for all components on whose reliability the safety of the boat depends
(even for those parts exposed to the water bomb effect) (see KM 9106 2.
January 1942) if non-high-quality factory toifs are particularly
prescribed. Stg 45 - 81 may only be used for components of minor
importance, insofar as they are not exposed to shocks or shocks.</p>
<p>For cast steel of any composition, it shall be indicated at the time of
ordering that a weight plus tolerance of 7 % shall be permitted, but
this must not be exceeded. If undermeasures can be allowed in the wall
thicknesses, appropriate notes shall be included in the drawings.</p>
<p>There is no limit to weight undercutting, as this is given by the
prescribed dimensional tolerances.</p>
<p>The sheath of the tower is to be made of special building material Wh o.

<p>The materials of other components not listed here are treated in the
corresponding groups.</p>
<p>The installation of light metals is largely restricted.</p>
<p>The compounds of light metals with heavy metals, copper, and copper
alloys, should be avoided as far as possible. Where they cannot be
circumvented, good electrical protection by means of protective coatings
(see S IV) must be ensured either on the light metal or on the heavy
metal in contact with the light metal or by packing swathes between
light metal and heavy metal. Galvanized or phosphated steel is best
suited as a heavy metal.</p>
<p>The regulations that the suppliers give to avoid anecration must be
observed.</p>
<p>For screws with high mechanical stress, e.g. on-board wall closures,
steel is used as a material ?? 8 G&lt;t (according to DIN 267) galvanically
galvanized to use. The nuts are made of material steel 5 D galvanized.</p>

non-pressure-resistant inncn cells, must in principle be provided with
two closures, one of which should lie directly on the board wall (see
standards of the Germaniawerft G. W. N. 130). Over board wall slipunder
NW 20 is decided on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Allo’s first on-board wall slip over NW 20 should basically be carried

relevant place encounters great difficulties or remains better out of
consideration for weight and slack.</p>
<p>All on-board wall closures and pressure body feeds, e.g. also for news
media, sonar systems, etc., which are exposed to external pressure, must
be fastened with expansion screws made of steel 8 G (DIN 267),
galvanized (see A3b). The screws shall be encased in reinforcement

<p>The handwheels and cranks of the first on-board wall ends must be marked
by balls.</p>
<p>All on-board wall closures, all second terminations, the intermediate
components and all reed components which can obtain external pressure or
higher operating pressures than the external pressure during normal
operation shall be designed for an operating pressure of 25 atm. They
must be sealed in a closed state against a test pressure of 32 atm and
be fixed in an open state against a test pressure of 40 atm without
licking noticeably (see also S II 6 a). If these reinforced connections
can no longer be procured in time, the previous ones used on the Type

<li><p>Pipelines, shut-off organs</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All pipes, flanges, fittings, and associated components must be sized
according to the latest naval standards, unless difficulties in
procurement and space issues require exceptions. For the reasons of
uniformity, the number of pipe widths to be used should be limited as
far as possible, and if possible, only pipes according to standard sheet
KM 7 for copper pipes and KM 8 for steel pipes should be used.</p>
<p>Each closure shall be connected to a display device which is easily
readable from the control point, from which it must be clearly seen
whether the closure is vzmt or soffen. It shall be such that the pointer
wanders on the pressure body skin or the bulkhead when closing, when
opening away from it.</p>
<p>All iron pipes laid under the hallway and outside the pressure body
shall be galvanized inside and outside unless otherwise required for
individual pipes.</p>
<p>The pipelines must be laid evenly upwards as far as possible without
sharp short arcs and to avoid air bags. Good expansion options must be
considered when arranging the flanges.</p>
<p>All pipes and fittings must be cleaned inside and outside before they
are installed on board. Pipes that are warmly bent with sand filling
must be carefully cleaned after bending by pickling, scratching, and
blowing and otherwise appropriately from burnt sand or peeling before
installation.</p>
<p>The shut-off bodies and interconnectors shall be arranged in such a way
that they can be maintained during operation. All water-carrying pipes
and fittings must be able to be completely drained by leaking screws.</p>
<p>The cranks and handwheels shall be executed in accordance with the

<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="7">
<li><p>Welding, rivets, and screwing</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The components of the pressure body must in principle be connected to
each other by means of electrical welding. Electric welding must also be
used as much as possible to save weight. In general, only butt welds
without overlaps and flaps are possible.</p>
<p>The assembly and execution of the welds are generally governed by the
welding regulation A. B. B. II No. 4 A, 2nd draft of 10 February 1940,
for the riveting the rienere regulation A. B. B. No 9, the RM/HNA
standard sheets Ni I to 5 and the decrees subsequently issued, unless
different agreements are made in accordance with the experience of the
shipyard.</p>
<p>For tank welding, see S I 18 b.</p>
<p>When welding flanges, particular care must be taken to ensure that, to
avoid excessively high shrink age, the openings are to be cut as
precisely as possible, according to the flange diameter, and the welds
are not to be carried out thicker than prescribed.</p>
<p>The drawings shall specify the type and thickness of the weld and the
electrode to be used.</p>
<p>Special emphasis must be placed on careful execution of oil-tight parts
welding.</p>
<p>The circular shape of the pressure body must not be affected in any way
by the welding, and the straight main axis of the pressure body must be
preserved.</p>
<p>The preservation of the circular shape must be demonstrated by the
imposition of mallen with precise radius of curvature.</p>
<p>Welding is, if possible, also applicable to the outer nave and upper
deck. For a few other components, riveting can be used according to the
drawings in question.</p>
<p>Special care must be taken when welding angle profiles with an
appropriate flange due to the round edge of the web. To achieve good
welding, the round edge of the flange must be cut off. When welding
angles with an adjacent pad, the appropriate snare of the adjacent
flange must be considered.</p>
<p>The water-resistance of riveted parts is . basically, due to stiffening.
to deliver. Only exceptionally, sealing material may be used with the
consent of the building inspectorate.</p>
<p>In the execution of the welds, care must be taken to ensure that the
succession of the welds takes place in such a way that the welding
stresses in the finished component, e.g., in the case of machine
foundations and bulkheads, are reduced to as little as possible. In the
case of difficult welds, the welding sequence shall be indicated on the
drawing.</p>
<p>An accumulation of welds at a short distance from each other is to be
avoided. The welds for all longitudinal and transverse bandages in the
pressure body and outer vessel shall have at least 60 mm distance from
the ring and longitudinal seams of the pressure body.</p>
<p>When welding thin components (bulkheads, cross beams, etc.) with
considerably thicker ones (pressure bodies, pressure-resistant
bulkheads, foundation beams, etc.) a transition must be created in stump
surges by chamfering the thick parts to the thickness of the thinner
ones.</p>
<p>Light walls under 3 mm are to be rhened with a flat iron, which is
welded to the pressure body skin.</p>
<p>Where necessary, screws can be used in place of rivets, which can be
made from seawater-resistant material wherever the danger of abrosing
endangers the safety of the boat. (See A 3 a.)</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="8">
<li><p>Galvanizing, zinc protection</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The rolling material of assembly S I cannot be galvanized without any
restriction. Special attention must be paid to good paint, especially
between components that are located on top of each other. Equipment,
fittings, brackets, mounting brackets on the outboard, etc. are easy to
galvanize. In addition, galvanized: iron pipes in the upper deck; and in
the biles, unless otherwise slammed.</p>
<p>All lighter rods and their bearings outside the pressure body shall be
galvanized or, to the extent necessary to maintain the gimgear, be made
of seawater-resistant material. During the war, the regulations on
savings must be observed.</p>
<p>In all cases where bronze and iron parts are permanently under seawater
in direct metallic contact, e.g. at the oars, in pipelines, etc., or
where otherwise, according to experience, edits have been found, there
is plenty of zinc protection, the design and application of which must
be carried out as uniformly as possible.</p>
<p>Fine zinc must be used in accordance with DIN 1706 for zinc protection
pieces. The bare metal of the zinc protection piece must be well applied
on the bare metali of the component. In the case of castings, the
connection between the protective piece and the component must be
ensured by well-directed screws.</p>
<p>Phosphated or rusted screws are not to be used for the connection of the
zinc protection with the component, since the phosphate and the rust
layer hinder the current transition between zinc protection, nut, screw,
and component. After each major operation of the boat, the zinc
protection flanges must be checked.</p>
<p>The lists of zinc protection flanges must be submitted to the O.K.M.</p>

on the foreedge of the spantstege.</p>
<p>If possible, the slats should consist of one piece. If local conditions
do not require a different position, the shock shall be arranged at the
top, according to the longitudinal seams of the pressure body
alternately on the Port and Starboard sides. In addition, the impacts of
adjacent slats should shoot about 1 m against each other.</p>
<p>In the area of crossbeam plates under the diesel engines D Spt. 18 to

is presented to the O.K.M.</p>
<p>If slats run through decks, cells, bunkers or tanks, the seal shall be
produced by welding.</p>
<p>In the case of dspanten, which pass through lateral inner bunkers or
tanks, air holes are to be placed at the highest point: they should lie
at ‘/g bridge height of the D Spantes, calculated from Mallkante
pressure bodies. The chippings must not be unduly weakened.</p>

must be welded with the adjacent components.</p>
<p>In addition, the torpedo cells 1 and 2 are to be set up for freshwater
over- and-remover-, to be able to use the cells as washing water cells.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="5">
<li><p>Dirty water cells</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In both accumulator rooms, one dirty water cell is to be ordered and

<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="6">
<li><p>Drift oil bunker</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The drift oil bunkers are located on the side of the rooms in front of
and behind the headquarters. They are connected by each cross bunker in
front of or behind the final bulkheads of the inner submersible cell.</p>
<p>The propellant oil bunker 1 reaches at the Starboard side in its lower
part from D Spt. 29 to D Spt. 41 and in its upper part from about 100 mm
behind D Spt. 32 to the central bulkhead 39; on the port side at the
bottom and above from about 100 mm behind D Spt. 32 to D Spt. 41 or
Schott 39.</p>
<p>The clear width between the two longitudinal bulkheads, which are
perimated vertically from bottom to top, is 2 440 mm. Both longitudinal
bunkers are connected by a cross bunker located only below the corridor,
the rear cross-bulkhead is 100 mm in front of D Spt. 38 and whose front
boundary forms the diving cell end bulkhead. The ceiling of the
transverse bunker is formed by the extended ceiling of the dive cell 3.</p>
<p>The drift oil bunker 2 ranges from the front dive cell end Schott 48 to
Schott 63. The clear width between the two longitudinal bulkheads is
also 2440 mm. The front boundary of the cross bunker is a bulkhead 200
mm behind D Spt. 51. The ceiling of the drift oil bunker 2 is generally
located at the height of the main axis, which is formed by the extended
submersible cell ceiling, which here is only 15 mm thick, as in bunker
1. The ceiling of the side bunkers is raised on the starboard side from
about D Spt. 55*/, to 61%, on the Port side from about D Spt. 52 to 61%
by 350 mm above main axis. For better flow of sweat water, the ceilings
must be laid on the side with a little fall. To drain the sweat water
from the ceiling of the propellant oil bunker in the officer’s room, the
longitudinal walls are to be led about 15 mm over the ceilings.</p>
<p>The longitudinal and transverse bulkheads are made of 7.5 mm sheets at
the bottom and 7 mm sheets at the top. The longitudinal bulkheads shall
be stiffened on each D Spt. by flat bead iron 100 - 8 and intercepted by
horizontal anchors made of flat bead iron 100 - 7 against the pressure
body braces. The flat bead irons on the longitudinal walls next to the
flat and battery compartment at the front must be welded continuously
from above to under the ammunition compartment ceiling for better
absorption of the clamping torques. The cross-scotts are to be stiffened
in the sense. The Bulkheads must be so strong that they can safely
absorb the thrust of the battery, which is produced at loads of up to
60° and in the case of crimping up to 60°. The longitudinal bulkheads
are to be provided with a stretchfold just before Schott D Spt. 63.</p>
<p>The fields between the vertical stiffeners shall be stiffened by
horizontally arranged flat iron saly at 75*8, the distances in the
battery cells are based on the position of the insulators, since these
flat irons serve at the same time for the lateral support of the battery
cells.</p>
<p>The propellant oil bunkers must be completely welded. Welding to Schott
63 is besondereSorgfa.lt, as experience shows that there are frequent
leaks here, so it is thicker than normal to be carried out. The D spans
in the bunkers are continuous. They are oil-tight to weld with the
intercostal edge plates.</p>
<p>During construction, care must be taken to ensure that the vent holes in
the pressure body panels of the inner bunkers are installed exactly
according to the drawing. The air holes should be arranged approximately
at % web height D Spt. from Mallkante pressure body skin and as high as
possible. The spant profile must not be unduly weakened. Residual air
must be removed by appropriate trimming and cruising (cf. SI 6b). The
bunkers are provided with oil-tight screwed manholes, which must be
accessible without undue work.</p>

<p>The rudders should each have an area of about 2.75 m. The axis of
rotation should divide the blade length of about 1400inm in the ratio 1
:.3. The leaf length is the connecting line of the center of the front
and rear edge of the leaf.</p>
<p>The rear depth rudders should each have an area of about 2.25 m, the
front depth rudders should each have an area of about 2.40 m.</p>
<p>For the rear deep rudders, the rudder blade length of 1225 mm,
determined in the same way as for the rudders, shall be divided in the
ratio 860 : 365.</p>
<p>In the front depth rudders, there should be about 1.65 m behind the axis
of rotation and 0.75 m<sup>2</sup> rudder surface in front of the axis of
rotation, i.e. it should not be more than the entire rudder surface in
front of the axis of rotation.</p>
<p>For the front depth rudders, only the specified area ratio is decisive.</p>
<p>The rudders should receive the following rashes:</p>
<p>Rudder: total rudder rash and naval rudder stop 30° on each side; End
layer shut-off is set to 28° on each side.</p>
<p>Rear deep rudder: total rudder rash and naval rudder stop 30° up and

33° downwards.</p>
<p>The red marks on the scales of the ifuder hands must be placed 2° before
setting the limit position switch or 4° before the naval rudder stop.</p>
<p>The naval rudder stops must not be allowed to precede on the outside.</p>
<p>In the end positions, only the fixed rudder stops and not the drive
parts of the rudder rods may come to the plant. For the depth rudders,
the lever sitting on the shafts should receive the lifting limit.</p>
<p>Rudder.</p>
<p>The rudders are 225 mm behind the torpedo tube support bulkhead Spt.—9
and 620 mm each from the center ship. Each rudder must be led to the
eighth edge of the torpedo tube support headboard at the bottom of a
heavy, barbed steel casting bearing. For the upper end of the rudder
shaft, a support and neck bearing made of cast steel must also be
provided.</p>
<p>Both bearings are in the flooded, watertight-lined niche behind the
torpedo tube support bulkhead Spt. —9. They must relate to the outer
skin, the bulkhead Spt. -—9 and the adjacent components so that the
rudder pressures are safely absorbed by the components of the rear
aisle. The rudder shafts are to be forged from St C 35 KM. They should
have a diameter of 215 mm in the ­lower support bearing and the other
dimensions according to the drawing. Each rudder shaft should receive a
thread at the top in which an eye-pin can be inserted.</p>
<p>Single-armed, two-piece rudder levers, initially forged from St C 35 KM,
must be carefully taken care of on the cones at the upper end of the
rudder shafts and fastened by means of springs (see S II 7 a).</p>
<p>To protect against basic contact, the lower edges of the rudder blades
must be about 1000 mm above the base.</p>

intended sprues at the rear stem (see S I 12a).</p>
<p>The front depth rudders shall be arranged on Spt. 100 (1200 mm in front
of the reference edge of the front bottom, 1500 mm above base) below the
torpedo tubes. Their shaft shall be stored in steel castings, which are
easy to attach in submersible cell 5 by frame clips and stringers.</p>
<p>The bearings of the front deep rudder shaft are to receive stuffing
bushes, which can be retracted from the inside of the submersible cell.
In the area of the steel castings, the outer skin must be reinforced
(see S I 11 b).</p>
<p>The rudder shaft common for both rudder blades of a deep rudder pair is
to be made from St C 35 KM. On each shaft a two-part rudder lever made
of St C 35 KM is to be placed. The hat nuts of the deep rudder shafts
are made of steel.</p>
<p>The smallest diameter in the cylindrical parts is 155 mm for the rear
depth rudder shaft and 167 mm for the front. The starboard bearings
(smallest diameter within the bearing points) should be 157 mm in
diameter for the rear deep rudder shaft and 170 mm in diameter for the
front deep rudder shaft.</p>
<p>The springs of the rudder shafts are particularly well matched.</p>
<p>The weight torque of the deep rudder leaves is to be compensated by iron

<p>Above rudder stands see S 11 7 b.</p>
<p>For hand rudder lines, see S II 7 c.</p>
<p>The drive of the rudders shall be led upwards between D Spt. 1 and 2
through the pressure body. On the vertical feed-through shaft, a lever
of 330 mm radius shall be attached within the pressure body, above the
pressure body a double lever with a radius of 400 mm on both sides. The
transfer from the double lever to the single-arm levers with 400 mm
radius, which sit on the rope rudder shafts, is to be carried out by two
long push rods made of seamless steel tube.</p>
<p>The rear deep rudder drive passes through the pressure body through the
rear end floor. The passage point is 680 mm above the main axis and 600
mm after the Starboard side from the center ship. Behind the rear end
bottom, between Spt. —1 and Spt. —2, an intermediate shaft is arranged,
on which two single-armed levers of 425 mm radius sit offset by 180°.
The push rods for the rear deep rudder drive attack at the lever ends.</p>
<p>The passage of the front deep rudder drive should take place at about D
Spt. 78 to D Spt. 79 through the lower part of the front pressure body
shot. For this purpose, an outlet nozzle must be placed, which shall be
poured from cast steel.</p>

<p>The rear depth rudders and at the same time the screws must be protected
by fixed transpellen made of steel casting, which are to be attached to
the shaft blocks at shaft height and stored in the rotary pins of the
depth rudders (see SI 12e).</p>
<p>The front depth rudders must be protected forward by narrow, fin-like,
built, solid deflectors, which must have a favorable shape for
overcoming the water resistance. They are to be built from cast steel
and slabs waterproof and filled with concrete or tarred wood before
installation. A dreli cone on the outer edges of the front-facing deep
rudder blades for storage in the rejector is not to be provided. They
should point upwards against the balance rights by about 5°, i.e. high
in the front.</p>
<p>To indicate the position of the depth rudders and screws, a 40 mm wide
color screed must be applied to the wooden deck in the screws and the
rear and front depth rudders. In addition, a clearly visible strip of
paint without inscription must be attached to the side of the upper
deck.</p>
<p>To protect the rudders, especially for basic touches, a hoe should be
provided (see SI 12b).</p>
<p>From the hoe, one arm of round cross-section shall be led to the two
rudders and stored at these cones. The arms shall be spread by a
crossbar of water-cut cross-section in such a way that the guide eyes of
the arms are easily attached to the rudder pins and thus rattling noises
are avoided. The crossbar must therefore be welded in during the
assembly of the rod on board.</p>
<p>All fixed dflectors shall be subdivided or ordered in such a way that a
slight</p>
<p>removal of the rudder blades and pulling of the rudder shafts is
ensured. At Vor­</p>

the cell ceiling and stringers.</p>
<p>On each slat, between the lower strings, in general, 7 mm thick floor
wrangrows are to be placed, which are to be provided with large openings
for the passage of the water. Slats, which are more stressed by special

forces occurring in the intermediate bearing, the ground wrangrows —3 to
0 shall be well connected by two intercostal longitudinal beams, which,
however, are not to be brought to the pressure body. The floor wrangling
of the dead wood shall be 9 mm thick and from Spt. 0 7 mm thick. The

<li><p>Hatch covers</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All hatches should have curved, outward-facing covers. The covers are to
be made of cast steel (see A3b), except for the tower hatch cover, which
is to be cast from the same material as the tower ceiling (see S I 18c).
The thickness of the cover should generally be 17 mm, the inner radius
of curvature about 900 mm for normal hatches and about 850 mm for
torpedo hatches. The top of the tower hatch is 30 mm thick and has an
inner curvature radius of 555 mm. Each lid should be provided with a
central lock that presses the lid firmly against the hatch coaming by
means of lugs. To operate the lock, a handwheel must be placed inside
and outside, on which the sense of movement for “open and close” is to
be indicated. A pendulum trap must be installed to prevent unintentional
actuation of the lock in the open position. Each cover must be equipped
with a secure snap lock that prevents the cover from jumping back after
it has been slammed, and with a locking device that holds the snap lock
in the tensioned state.</p>
<p>In addition, detachable hatch safety devices are to be provided on each
hatch cover, which can be used if attacks with depth charges are to be
feared. In the case of the tower hatch cover, which is to be provided
with a worm drive, there is no need to attach these hatch locks. These
fuses are also unnecessary on the central hatch cover.</p>
<p>So that each individual lid can be opened easily, its weight must be
balanced by springs, which must be dimensioned accordingly. The tower
hatch cover is to be equipped with 2 springs. It must be considered that
the flaps of the upper deck hinged to the companionway and torpedo
hatches must also be opened at the same time.</p>
<p>The weights of similar covers must match the weights given on the
drawings within the tolerance so that the hatch springs can be easily
replaced. The springs of the central hatch cover are to be dimensioned
so that they can be used as reserve springs for the tower hatch cover.
About the diameter of the steer yourself S I 4 f.</p>
<p>The central locks of all hatches should be able to be opened not only
from the inside, but also from the outside, so that a diver can get into
the interior of the boat through each hatch if the hatch protection
against depth charges has not been attached inside the boat.</p>
<p>A locking device for the open cover must be attached to all hatches,
except for the tower hatch. The tension of the relief springs for the
tower hatch and the position of the stopper for the open position are to
be coordinated so that the tower hatch is sufficiently fixed in the open
position without a locking device. The storage and guidance of the tower
hatch cover is particularly strong. Ahe stoppers are to be attached in
such a way that the hatch covers are not stressed on one side when
striking against them. The central hatch should be able to be slammed
quickly from below through the depth control ladder. The top of the
tower hatch must be provided with 1 handle so that it can be closed
quickly if a lake suddenly comes over. The handle must be clear of the
stop to avoid hand injuries when opening the cover.</p>
<p>The lids of the tower hatch and the companionway hatch are to have a
sampling valve.</p>
<p>The sealing of all hatch covers should be done by guinmi profiles, which
are attached to the covers and rest on metal rails to be let into the
coamings of the hatches. The Guinmi profiles are to be fitted and glued
into the dovetail-shaped grooves with great care. Oil-resistant Buna
according to workshop standard sheet RM9602 must be used for torpedo
hatches, diesel air head and foot valves, room air head and foot valves,
quick vents for diving times, emergency shut-off flaps for diving cells
and diving bunkers (see A 3 b). The standardization of the Guinmi
profiles is to be used as a basis for the dimensions of the rubber
profiles.</p>
<p>The flaps to be installed over the companionway hatches and torpedo
hatches on the upper deck should be connected to the hatch covers in
such a way that they open and close together with them and are held in
their closed position by the hatch covers. They are to be connected to
the hatch covers by bolts that can be easily released from the upper
deck, so that the diver can loosen these connections to gain access to
the locks of the hatch covers.</p>
<p>Around the companionway hatches and torpedo hatches, shafts are to be
built from light metal sheets to protect them from impact by the sea and
are to be provided with flood and drainage openings. The flaps of these
flood openings are closed when the hatch cover is open and opened when
the hatch cover is closed.</p>

rubber seals that seal the base angle rings made of cast steel, which
are connected to the bulkheads by double riveting (see page 17b).</p>
<p>The door is to be pressed onto the sealing surface by a collar ring
lock, which must be operable from both sides of the bulkhead by means of
a toothed segment with a hand lever. The collar rings are to be made
from Stg 45.81 Bk or welded together from fluoro iron. Sufficient
lubrication must be ensured so that rusting on is absolutely avoided.
The lock ring hinge must be blocked to prevent it from shifting when the
door is open. It must be possible to fix the door when it is open.</p>
<p>The watertight bulkheads D Spt.l6 ‘/ g, 29 and 03 should have door
openings with a clear width of 1450 * 550 mm. The doors must be
provided with sash locks on the long and short sides. The sash locks on
the long sides are to be connected to each other by rods so that they
can be closed with two handles from each bulkhead side. A locking
mechanism must be provided to prevent the sash turns unintentionally

<p>The screwing of the manhole and hand hole lids should generally be done
by iron pin screws and nuts, which are to be well set with lead white.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="5">
<li><p>Entrance hatches in the inner deck.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 5 mm thick siphone lids to the ammunition chamber, the room for
T-devices and the battery compartments are to be arranged flush with the
deck. The clear width of the entrance openings should generally be 500
* 500 mm. The hatch in the room for T-devices is given 500-400 light
width (see S19d).</p>
<p>The hatch covers are to be sealed on all sides by front ruporter
ruporter seal. They are given handles sunk in shells and are to be
covered with linoleum in the same way as the inner deck.</p>
<p>The hatch cover for the ammunition chamber must be locked and provided
with an easily stashed grass. To be able to use the T-device room as a
supply load, a lockable grass lid must also be supplied. For each
battery compartment, a wooden inlay with air holes must be made and
holdered under the battery cover.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="6">
<li><p>Battery cover plates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The battery compartments must be covered with airtight screwed 5 mm
thick plates fitted with ruporter seals to allow easy expansion of the

be provided with a linoleum coating outside the lockers, which shall be
glued and secured by galvanized iron rails at the edges.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="7">
<li><p>Flaps in the upper deck.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Special care must be taken to secure all flaps in the upper deck.</p>
<p>The upper deck flaps, insofar as they are in the iron-plated upper deck
part, shall be made of sheets of the thickness of the iron plating and
shall be provided above, like the iron-plated parts of the upper deck,
with welding cues against slipping. All flaps should be flush with the
deck. The edge of the flaps must be stiffened by welded flat irons.
Larger flaps are particularly good to stiffen against sea strikes.</p>
<p>Flaps located in the wood-planked upper deck part are generally to be
made of angular frame 30-30-4 mm or 30-45-4 mm and 2.5 mm belt plates,
which are to be reinforced with larger flaps by diagonal bands, angular
stiffeners or so. The angular frames shall be filled with a surface of
pine wood, according to the upper deck plating. The planks are to be
arranged longitudinal vessels (see S115e).</p>
<p>The wood in the flaps should lie flush with that of the upper deck.</p>
<p>The flaps are generally to be placed in such a way that they open after
the bow.</p>
<p>All flaps, especially the large ones, must be provided in sufficient
numbers with strong hinges and with powerful! safe and tightly closing
rear-turned screws, which are to be operated with a key, so that the
flaps do not rattle during the journey and are necessarily secured
against being knocked out by sea strike.</p>
<p>Flaps, which must also be opened by the diver, must be equipped with
so-called divers. These diver’s foretours shall be carried out for right
and left in such a way that they cannot be gradually loosened by sea
strikes; a right-wing and a left-wing version must therefore be chosen
for them.</p>
<p>On the fore and back, one flap is to be provided with divers’ forehand.
Under these flaps, one key for the operation of the other upper deck
flaps to be closed with rear-screw screws shall be holder.</p>
<p>The flaps for the diver must be so large that the diver can approach the
fittings without any difficulties and hit hoses well.</p>
<p>The flaps above the large upper deck openings (the torpedo hatches,
etc.) must be subdivided so that they can be easily handled. They are
particularly easy to stiffen and fasten so that they cannot strike in
heavy seas. Where necessary, beams must be pulled over the large flaps.</p>
<p>The flaps over the boarding and torpedo hatches shall be connected to
the lids of the hatches themselves; they should be opened and closed
with them (see SU la).</p>
<p>The flaps of the standby ammunition boxes must be provided with divers’
forepieces. The flaps must be closed by padlocks. In the area of the
magnetic photo compass, the frames of the kiappene and the fittings are
made of non-magnetizable material (see S115f).</p>
<p>Very small flaps are made of galvanized caterpillar sheet. All flaps are
provided with handles in shells, which get a small drainage hole.</p>
<p>Flaps via vent valves do not receive slots. Shells that receive a small
drainage hole are to be provided under handle holes.</p>
<p>Flaps over thaw loads must be provided with a quarter-round cutout in
the corner, which indicates the corresponding bollard, so that the rope
can run through it.</p>
<p>For larger parts, such as exhaust valves and similar devices, must be
fitted to bolted, framed upper deck panels for overhaul work, if these
areas are not accessible by flaps. For’s exhaust-air-exhaust distributor
is to install a flap.</p>
<p>All flaps, hinges, pre-resider, label marks and the like must be placed
in the wooden deck to avoid all protruding edges and corners as far as
possible.</p>

<p>Trimmlitung,</p>
<p>Drinking water pipe,</p>
<p>(k)washing water pipe,</p>
<p>Various branch lines.</p>
<p>General.</p>
<p>Zinc protection: Zinc protection plates or rings shall be provided to
prevent galvanic eating in places where seawater is permanently in
contact with bronze and iron. Protective elements against eating must be
affixed in the seawater-carrying copper pipes (see also standard sheet
KM 61 and A 4i).</p>
<p>Material: Pipes: Flow iron galvanized inside and outside. Cables that
pass-through fuel oil bunkers, engine oil tanks and battery compartments
are only to be galvanized inside. Hot seawater pipes: CCuF25 (galvanized
during the war, however). Particularly thick-walled pipes shall be used
for the pipes which are exposed to seawater outside and inside, as well
as for the pipe pieces that are directly attached to the suction and
pressure nozzles of the pumps.</p>
<p>Fittings: Larger valves or sliders are made of cast steel or steel
welded and galvanized. Smaller fittings are made of galvanized steel
casting, see A3b. For the valve seats, carrying welding (electrical arc
welding or gas melt welding) of suitable composition shall be used.
Interior parts, if necessary, red casting.</p>
<p>The application welding must not detach from the valve seat under
warranty, even under the sharpest loads.</p>
<p>Small valves and through valves can be made of bronze, but the use of
fuel must be largely avoided.</p>
<p>The first on-board wall valves of all cables should in principle be
designed as Kingston valves (closing with your water pressure) (see
A4c). When assembling and installing the fittings, care must be taken to
ensure that the display devices do not block the fittings until sic is
completely closed or opened.</p>
<p>Test pressure: Suction lines of the main and auxiliary ducts as well as
lime milk pipes must generally be tested with 3 atm sample pressure.
Annaturen and pipes that can receive high pressures during operation,
e.g., fittings in the main duct line, which are exposed to high
pressures when the control cells are flooded or when expressing with
compressed air at depth, are to be designed for an operating pressure of
25 atm, as well as all first and second on-board closures.</p>
<p>Test pressures for these fittings and cables see A 4e.</p>
<p>Pipelines passing through the pressure body, through cells, bunkers or
tanks should be laid and welded in before the pressure test of the rooms
concerned. Likewise, all reinforcement flanges must be welded into the
walls of the rooms to be tested before the pressure test. In the case of
screw flanges, the subsequent components must be mounted. In the absence
of the connecting parts, reinforcement flanges must be sealed before the
pressure test by blind flanges. Before the first commissioning and after
repairs of the pipes odct fittings, the suctions for the detection of
their airtightness must also be pressed with compressed air and checked
by brushing with soapy water.</p>
<p>Drainage screws for complete drainage of the pipelines shall be
provided.</p>
<p>All pipelines must be laid as straight and evenly as possible to avoid
unnecessary resistance and air borne. Where necessary, accessible
protective screens must be ordered.</p>
<p>Care must be taken to ensure that, in normal circuits (e.g., suction
with Hill’slenz pump from auxiliary duct line or sucking with main loop
pump from main loop line) cross-sectional changes during the lines are
avoided as far as possible in all cases.</p>
<p>All shut-off organs, junctions, manifolds, etc. should be properly
formed to reduce the flow resistance. Branches should be connected at
angles. &lt;</p>
<p>When setting up the pumps and laying the pipeline, the greatest
attention must be paid to noise attenuation during operation. All
operating noise must be largely attenuated by intermediate pieces of
vibrating metal or in any other appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Overflow or vent lines should end visibly over corridors. They must be
led over catch hoppers after the bilge. If necessary, several pipelines
can be guided via a common funnel.</p>

<p>An electrically driven self-priming centrifugal pump is to be installed
in the central center (see M, M II 6).</p>
<p>An electrically driven trim pump, which is also intended to serve as an
auxiliary pump, is also to be placed in the control panel (see M, M 11
7).</p>
<p>The main bilge pump as well as the auxiliary and trim pump must be
provided with a shut-off valve at the suction and pressure side.</p>
<p>A double-acting hand piston pump type “Frankonia Nr. 5v” from Klein,
Schanzlin &amp; Becker, Frankenthal is to be supplied as a hand-held pump.
This pump is supposed to provide about 164 1 at 66 double strokes per
minute. In the cast-iron pump housing, the suction and pressure valves
trained as cone valves are to be placed. A normal hose coupling (storz
coupling) N W 52 according to DIN FEN must be installed on the suction
and pressure side of the pump. However, the connection hoses (pressure
and suction hoses) also supply with delivery receive only 45 mm light
width. The coupling halves NW 52, which are seated on the hoses, are
therefore to be sonicated with (abnormal) hose sleeves for connection to
45 hoses.</p>
<p>The handbil pump is fixed in a suitable place, easy to reach and easy to
stow. The pump receives a footboard so that it can be placed at any
point. In the storage position’ the footboard serves as a sination board
in the E machine room.</p>
<p>In the kitchen a hand-wing pump is to be provided as a drinking water
pump, in the control center also a hand-wing pump is to be placed in the
pipe between drinking water generator and drinking water cell 1. In the
suction nozzle of the drinking water hand pump in the kitchen, a
ball-beating valve is to be installed, which prevents an idle of the
pump housing after pumping.</p>
<p>In the bow room, a hand-held pump for washing water is to be installed
from the torpedo cells and in the front toilet dream another hand-held
pump for conveying from the washing cell in the front accumulator space.
(c) flood and bilge devices of the control, undershoot and torpcdo
cells.</p>
<p>The control cclals and bunkers are to be flooded by a bottom valve NW
140, which is to be placed in the control center. The Ted of the control
cells above the waterline must be replenished with the main feed pump. A
valve box NW 140 with a connection to the distribution valve box of the
control cells and to the suction line of the main loop pump shall be
connected to the bottom valve. The flood lines of the four regei cells
or bunkers receive NW 100. The bottom valve must be operated at any
water depth of up to 120 m. For this purpose, pressure compensation can
be prepared via the vent valve in the fine-tuning line of the control
cells. The bottom valve is given a compressed air connection for blowing
through.</p>
<p>A Seevent.il NW 00 for the fine flooding of the control cells and
bunkers must be installed in the pressure body skin behind the tower. To
protect against contamination, a top-tight hood perforated on the sides
must be put on at the outlet. A quantity counter shall be connected to
the nw 60 fine flood line, which shall be set up for both flow
directions (i.e., for floods and lenzen). The fine lululine receives a
double termination. The first end should close with the external
pressure, the second against the external pressure. A vent valve NW 20
must be connected to the fine flood line so that pressure compensation
can be prepared in the controller, flood, and bilge valves for easier
opening of these valves. The control cclals and lunkers must be equipped
with water levels, which are to be placed in the control center.</p>
<p>Water level glasses made of plexiglass of standardized design must be
provided for all control cells and bunkers. Valves must be installed as
barriers.</p>
<p>The lenzing of the control cells and bunkers should be carried out by
the main bilge pump. The distribution box with four valves NW 100 for
the control cells is to be used for both lenzen and flooding the control
cells. All four valves therefore receive fixed cones. The connecting

</li>
</ol>
<p>In the front toi) of the upper deck, an anchor winch, connected with
VcrholspiH, shall be incorporated for the anchor extension described in
SI21. The spin system is to be driven by an air motor, which is to be
stcllcn in the bow room, protected from moisture. In addition, a drive
must be provided by hand by means of the holspillhead, which can be set
up on the upper deck.</p>
<p>The switching on and off as well as the re-knocking of the air motor
must be operated by a linkage, which is to be operated from the upper
deck.</p>
<p>For the engine, see M, M II 2.</p>
<p>The chain feed between the anchor and the chain must not rest on the nut
of the anchor winch. Between the Lcitrollc and the winch is a
chain-knob, whose jaws are to be rounded off well, so that the rushing
chain does not stick. The operation of the chain knob must be set up
from the upper deck.</p>
<p>Transmission linkage, anchor spill.</p>
<p>The air motor is to be coupled with the worm corrugatof of a worm gear
by means of an elastic ruporter bolt coupling. The shaft of the worm
wheel must be placed vertically and pass through the pressure body by
means of a stuffing box. At the upper end of the worm wheel shaft, a
claw clutch must be firmly wedged. The latter is supposed to intervene
in the counter-claws of a sleeve, which sits with a spring on the lower
end of the vertical spill shaft and can be moved in and out. The sleeve
should generally always be switched on. It shall only be removed in an
emergency if the spill must be operated by the manual drive because of a
failure on the air motor from the upper deck. The rod for moving out the
sleeve is therefore only to be led to the upper deck.</p>
<p>A bevel gear is to be wedged onto the vertical Spillwellc, through which
the anchor winch is to be driven.</p>
<p>The upper end of the vertical Spillwellc is to be stored in the lower
part of the verholspill, which is to be fixed on the upper deck. The
Spillwclte is supposed to drive the spill head.</p>
<p>The spill head shall be connected to the vertical Spillwellc by means of
a removable coupling and formed in such a way that it can also be used
for hi-hating the anchor of Hpnd. It shall be set up for both directions
of rotation and provided with the appropriate locking jacks. The spill
head should be easily and quickly removable and can be stored in the
construction deck; in operation, it must be able to be secured against
unintentional lifting.</p>
<p>Further forward in the aisle, the anchor winch is to be set up under the
upper deck, which should consist of a strong boek of steel casting, in
which the shaft with the chain nut must be stored.</p>
<p>Between the vertical spill shaft and the chain nut wcllc, a shaft must
be placed horizontally under the upper deck. A bevel gear is to be
mounted on the rear end of the same, which is driven by the bevel wheel
on the vertical Spillwellc. A bevel gear is also to be mounted on the
front end of the horizontal shaft, which drives the bevel gear on the
chain nut wcllc.</p>
<p>The bevel wheel on the chain nutwelJe should run loosely and obtain
claws on one side, which intervene in the claws of a movable sleeve
attached on the chain nut wcllc with a spring. By switching on the
sleeve, the anchor winch is indented. The displacement of the mulle is
to be advertised by a rod, which can be operated from the upper deckThe
translation of the bevel gears and the screw drive are to be chosen in
such a way that the air motor runs both at a chain speed of lOm/min and
at a speed of the Vcrholtrosse of 20 m/min nüt the same normal speed of
740.</p>
<p>The chain nut should receive 6 teeth for the hieven of the anchor chain.
It must be provided with a) protection to prevent the chain from
jumping. A handbrake shall be connected to the nut nut, which must be
strong in such a way that, when the drive motor is disconnected, it
prevents the chain nut from turning even if the chain is stressed up to
its breaking load.</p>
<p>The actuation of the handbrake should be possible by means of a rod from
the upper deck.</p>
<p>In the upper deck, a clearly visible mechanical display device must also
be cin, which receives its drive from the horizontal chain nut shaft and
whose scale shows how many meters of chain are inserted and when the
anchor sits in the knob.</p>
<p>All parts of the spill ingesum shall be carried out so vigorously that
they are not yet loaded up to the flow limit in the event of a load on
the winch corresponding to the breaking load of the chain.</p>
<p>The outerboard shafts, on which couplings are arranged movable, are to
be made of stainless steel.</p>
<p>In the chain box, a clipper for the anchor chain must be installed,
which can be detached from the inside of the boat. The triggering device

operation in the sea. The hot reep must be led via a foot and guide
block to the holspill.</p>
<p>The torpedoes should always be guided during insertion into the pressure
body, into the torpedo tubes and into the reserve bearings in such a way
that they cannot make large movements of their own when the boat moves.
For this purpose, sliding troughs, rails, etc. shall be provided in an
appropriate form and based on great safety. The transport device shall
be designed in such a way that it is also possible to store a torpedo
clay of one pipe in another pipe and to store and pick up the reserve
torpedoes.</p>
<p>The belts for transport ingession and straightening within the pressure
body are to be made of steel strips. The finished belts shall be subject
to a test load of 1 600 kg prior to boarding.</p>
<p>Special belts for quick entry must be supplied.</p>
<p>The loading of the torpedo tubes must be carried out with built-in
flooring and built-in berths, which are left in place and equipped with
perfect berths. The regulations for ammunition transport equipment must
be observed. For the torpedo hatches, safety crosses must be provided.</p>
<p>The parts for the torpedo transport as well as for the snow-loading

<p>In general, the choice of the painting system (painting and coating
sequence) is based on the new draft of A. B.B. No. 31, edition 41, the
“painting regulation for submarines” of Deschimag <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id8" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>, Bremen, and the
subsequent additions, which are based on the results of the color test
programs.</p>
<p>The shipyards must communicate the painting systems which they choose
for the exterior paints above and under water and the interior paints
and the changes that occur therein to the O.K.M.</p>
<p>Since the protective effect of the coatings depends on the careful
cleaning of the painting base and the conscientious execution of the
base coat as well as on the good drying of the paints, each individual
painting must be completely dried through before a new coat may be
applied to it. Special care must be taken to the good ventilation of the
rooms.</p>

painted in the lower part, in the exposed pressure body skin up to the
edge plates of the lateral fuel oil bunkers, with the acid protection
inks provided for in <strong>A.B.B. No. 31</strong> The paint with acid protection
paints must be pulled up a little over the connection points of the
drift oil bunker edge plates. The end bulkheads of the battery
compartments shall also be painted up to the same height from below with
these acid protective colors; the same coating should continue to be
given to the accumulator foundations (scaffolds).</p>
<p>The part of the battery compartments above the specified area (vertical
drift oil bunker wall, upper part of the end bulkhead, battery ceiling,
etc.) is triple with acid protection paint according to War- <strong>A.B.B.
