a) Corrections to Building Regulations

The shipyard shall submit a quarterly (beginning of January, April,
July, October) to a compilation of the changes to be made in the
building regulations, according to which the copies therein must be
corrected.

Changes to the building regulations which are deemed necessary must be
notified by the shipyard to the O.K.M. quarterly (at the latest by 1
January, T. April, 1 July, 1 October).

They shall be included by the O.K.M. after examination in the
compilation of the amendments and shall be entered in the building
regulations in accordance with the instructions of the O.K.M.

Insofar as these are changes which result in a construction delay or
additional costs, the express consent of O.K.M. must be obtained before
execution.

b) Inconsistencies

Should there be any discrepancies between the building regulations, the
contract drawings and the delivery instructions, the decision of the
O.K.M. must be obtained.

If the building regulations S refer to mechanical engineering components
and to the building regulation M, the construction regulation M remains
decisive for the execution of these mechanical engineering components.

c) Nature.

The submarine shall be manufactured in all its parts of the most
suitable material in impeccable work in an impeccable manner and
permanently, considering the latest experience.

d) Completeness

The components and equipment not mentioned in the following provisions,
which are still necessary for the performance, safety and safe operation
of the submarine and its equipment, shall also be provided for.

In addition to this special building regulation for the hull of type VII
C submarines, the construction of the building is subject to the

**General Building Regulations for the Hull of Ships, Boats, and special
ships of the Kreigsmarine (A.B.V. -S-)**

**General Building Regulations for Submarines (A.B.B. F.U.)**

**General Building Regulations for the Ship Buildings of the Navy
(A.B.B. I and II green; and A.B.B. blue).**

All additions, improvements and fittings that have already been carried
out in a series of submarines are to be provided accordingly also on
these submarines, even if this building regulations do not specifically
mention this. In case of doubt, please contact The O.K.M.

e) Delivery of Drawings and Books

The presentation, execution and delivery of drawings, sketchbooks,
descriptions, operating instructions, and ship books must be carried out
in accordance with The A.B.B. No. 1 and A. B. B. I No.’s 8 and No. 9
unless special provisions require otherwise.

#. A 2 Building Weights

   a) Weight set-up

In the construction and equipment of the hull, the weights listed in the
following weight stroke (as of 1 July 1943) are not to be exceeded for
each group of the building regulations.

a) S IV Mater workshop.

b) Weighing

The individual parts of the hull shall be weighed in accordance with the
above grouping and shall be subscripted among the groups of the weighing
registers of the same name.

The submarines to be weighed are specified in the delivery instructions.

Loose articles of use must be booked under y equipment and not under
'hulls'.

Parts for mechanical engineering purposes that are firmly connected to
the boat body, such as brackets, pressure body penetrations for
mechanical parts, are to be recorded in the corresponding ship
assemblies.

Insofar as these parts form part of the compressive body plating, such
as pressure body penetrations for mechanical parts, they must be weighed
in the group SI4. The flooring of all rooms, including those of the
diesel engine room and the E engine room, must be weighed in the ship
group S I 9.

Floor sheets or stepping strips which are firmly connected to machines
shall be recorded and weighed under M I 15.

Note y see n means that the above-mentioned component must be booked
under the group to which reference is made, the note s.c.n states that
at the indicated point also provisions have been made on the mentioned
component.

The note vn means that the component in question must be weighed in the
case of mechanical engineering in accordance with the building
regulations for the machine plant (construction regulation M).

c) Proof of weight

The weight and center of gravity of all components must be calculated
based on the drawings prior to construction and compared with the weight
stroke. The weights weighed must be constantly compared with the
estimated weights during construction. Which boats are to be weighed is
specified in the delivery instructions.

The installed weights shall be communicated to the building inspectorate
by group, separately, every quarter of a year in such a way that the
building inspectorate can make the quarterly reports on time.

The weighing books must be delivered to the O.K. M. after completion.

d) Proof of displacement

During the construction, the over- and underwater displacements and
priority calculations are to be compared with the building documents.

e) Calculation shefte

On the basis of the proofs of weight and displacement referred to in (c)
and dispersed, the submarines to be weighed in accordance with the
delivery instructions for the assessment of the stability and the trim
and swimming position for normal and large payload shall be required
every 4 months (in addition, as soon as possible shortly before the
shipyard trim of the first submarine), to draw up predatory and priority
calculations and to submit them to the O.K.M. on 15, 3, 15, 7 and 15.As
with other major deviations from the invoice, stannnwerft must be sent
an interim invoice without being requested, as is the case with other
major deviations from the invoice.

After completion of the construction, the final weight, displacement,
and priority calculation must be delivered to the O.K.M. based on the
weighing book.

The weights weighed must be used in the weight calculations, as far as
this is possible up to the time. These groups must then be specially
identified.

In addition, the additional and lower weights of the individual groups
shall be entered in a special column, provided that their weight differs
from that of the main yard. The resulting stability and trim changes
must be reported.

The invoices are to be included for the for water and underwater
swimming pool: the weights, the displacements, the focal points for the
individual groups of the hull, the machinery and equipment, as well as
the stability for the stress cases specified in the calculation of the
main shipyard.

In addition, a compilation of the main information and the cell, bunker
and tank contents shall be attached and the Forwater swimming position
shall be indicated for all stress cases.

The calculation scales are to be produced in only 6 copies, two of which
are intended for the shipyard, the building supervision and the O.K.M.
The special confidentiality provisions must be observed.

f) O.K.M. Building Reserve

A building reserve of the O.K.M. is not provided.

g) Building reserve of the construction yard

The construction reserve of the shipyard is 1.50 t.

h) In-service reserve

The required Inservice reserve of 1.50 t may not be used for
modifications during construction. Their focus is to be assumed to be
half the pressure body length and the half body diameter. (See S I 24c.)

#. A3 Materials

   a) General

The materials to be used for the hull, etc., should comply with the
material standards of the Kriegsmarine. In drawings, bills of materials,
etc., the standardized short characters are generally to be used.
Non-standard special materials may only be used for fewer, important
components. Procurement and acceptance must be carried out in accordance
with the latest delivery conditions and acceptance regulations of the
Kriegsmarine.

Only in the case of low-stressed components of minor importance can
acceptance be dispensed with in agreement with the building supervision

All materials for more important components may only be purchased from
companies listed in the Navy's supplier list.

The use of savings materials must be restricted as far as possible, but
this must not reduce operational safety.

In the case of vital components, fuels may be replaced by substitutes
only if they are equivalent in all respects and this does not affect the
safety of the submarine and the reliability of the components.

During the war, the war-related austerity regulations apply, which must
be observed closely.

All dubious cases must be resolved with the main shipyard and its
construction supervision or the O.K.M.

Heat treatment and the hot and cold processing of the materials must be
carried out properly, in the case of alloys or special steels only under
the conditions specified by the material manufacturer.

A processing of rolled materials made of flux steel in a blue-warm state
may not be carried out because of the brittleness that may occur. If
necessary, the warmly processed parts must be re-heated normally after
processing.

All sheets which are to be galvanized later are not to be appropriated
at the time of delivery and must not be varnished.

The materials for components in contact with seawater shall be chosen in
such a way as to avoid galvanic anemic eating.

For the processing of the printing bulkhead, see S I 7 b.

b) Material selection

All components of rolled material which can be claimed in normal
operation with 12 atm corresponding to an immersive depth of 120 m, as
well as all the chippings, angles, reinforcements, and other joints
required for these components, shall be manufactured from St. 52 KM, the
weldability of which shall be demonstrated. These parts include: the
pressure body skin, the plating of the control and understatement cells
and the (inner) submersible cell 3, the final bulkhead of the
submersible cell 3 and all the slats and reinforcements required for
these components, on the other hand, the bulkheads of control and
understatement cells from St 42 KM are to be produced. Slats that are
bent cold must be made of aluminum-calmed material.

For the plates made of St 52 KM, the tolerance for boiler plates
according to the latest regulations of the German Kriegsmarine applies
as the thickness tolerance. The sheets should preferably not have an
undersized and must not exceed the permissible excess. If the collection
points or the sheet metal processing yards or steel construction
companies find any deviations in thickness beyond the values permitted
under the boiler plate tolerances, these shall be communicated to the
O.K.M. on presentation of a sketch of the measuring points and
indication of the shot, which decides on a case-by-case basis on the
possibility of use.

The weldability of all materials to be used and welded must be
demonstrated.

All other components, unless otherwise specified and in so far as they
are subordinate parts, shall be manufactured from St 42 KM or Thomas
steel. For the use of Thomas steel in submarine construction, see O.K.M.
disposition KIBm No. 1626/43 dated 12.5.43.

If different materials are to be used for individual series than those
specified here for the pressure body skin, etc., the shipyards concerned
will receive special instructions.

Strong flat irons, which are used for enclosing openings, such as the
slurry of the pressure-resistant manhole openings and the edge flat
irons of the pressure-resistant bulkhead, are to glow normally before
welding in. See S I 7b

Insofar as steel casting is required, stg 45-81 BK is generally required
for all components on whose reliability the safety of the boat depends
(even for those parts exposed to the water bomb effect) (see KM 9106 2.
January 1942) if non-high-quality factory toifs are particularly
prescribed. Stg 45 - 81 may only be used for components of minor
importance, insofar as they are not exposed to shocks or shocks.

For cast steel of any composition, it shall be indicated at the time of
ordering that a weight plus tolerance of 7 % shall be permitted, but
this must not be exceeded. If undermeasures can be allowed in the wall
thicknesses, appropriate notes shall be included in the drawings.

There is no limit to weight undercutting, as this is given by the
prescribed dimensional tolerances.

The sheath of the tower is to be made of special building material Wh o.
Mo., the ceiling of the tower including the tower lid (see S II 1a) of
steel casting of the following chemical composition (indicative values)
and minimum strength values:

+----------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| C              | Si             | Mn              | V               |
+================+================+=================+=================+
| 0.20-0.25%     | 0.35-0.50%     | 1.0-1.2%        | 0.10-0.15%      |
+----------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

| Tensile strength: 55 kg/mm\ :sup:`2`.
| Yield strength: 40kg/mm\ :sup:`2`.
| Elongation at 1 = 5d 15%.
| Constriction: = 50%.
| Notch impact strength = 10 kg/cm\ :sup:`2`.

In the event of significant deviations in the chemical composition of
the cast steel from the guide values, the decision of the O.K.M. shall
be obtained. The specific properties of the material which the yard
intends to use for the tower ceiling shall be communicated to the O.K.M.
before ordering the decision.

In a range of 900 mm sphere radius around the magnetic compass, measured
by center compass rose, un-magnetizable material shall be used.

The materials of other components not listed here are treated in the
corresponding groups.

The installation of light metals is largely restricted.

The compounds of light metals with heavy metals, copper, and copper
alloys, should be avoided as far as possible. Where they cannot be
circumvented, good electrical protection by means of protective coatings
(see S IV) must be ensured either on the light metal or on the heavy
metal in contact with the light metal or by packing swathes between
light metal and heavy metal. Galvanized or phosphated steel is best
suited as a heavy metal.

The regulations that the suppliers give to avoid anecration must be
observed.

For screws with high mechanical stress, e.g. on-board wall closures,
steel is used as a material ?? 8 G<t (according to DIN 267) galvanically
galvanized to use. The nuts are made of material steel 5 D galvanized.

To eliminate the possibility of confusing oil-resistant with
non-oil-resistant Buna in operation, for all seals only oil-resistant
Buna, which is the in the **material standard sheet KM9602 in the
group** “gi-ol” requirements.

Profile ruporter should be secured by gluing against tearing out of the
groove and must not be pulled.

2. A 4 Construction

   a) Gewicbtseinrestrictedmg, arrangement utu! Execution of the
      components.

The safety and reliability <ier bauausfi'duung must not be put in l'hage
on vain construction and weight saving.

Ade Hauteiie.inslx'sondere cables and pipelines, are as deep as they are
awkward to lay) and for the purpose of confumviei'ung with now the most
12 now distance from the pressure clatter and from idlen schwilzw assot
leading parts.

Smooth attsfiihmng of the ScbilTsbody.

The AußonschifT should have as few protruding edges and components as
possible, also upper lmlb of the waterline; Rttdorrahmet), rejectors and
all components installed on the upper deck or protruding outwards shall
be carried out in a water-sclined manner and. where et required, be
disguised in such a way that troughs cannot hook on the submarine.

b) Smooth export of the ships body

Near the flood opening and the outboard ventih' are to avoid upwards of
bent sheets and upright f lanschen as much as possible xu. For example,
sand absorbed in the case of ground Liegon must be able to be rinsed
away at billowing or atts buportles, so that the pipes and inner cell])
cannot be contaminated and the pumps cannot be damaged. The rooms
covered by hats as well as the lower part of the outside diving cells
and the keel must also be protected from the ATrsandcn.

c) Interchangeability of components

Any components for which replacement may be possible after the
completion of the submarines must be replaced. Spare parts must be
manufactured like the built-in parts and worked to the extent that they
can be installed without particularly difficult and time-consuming
rework.

All nuts should be tightened with normal keys if possible. In addition,
if sondcrscldüssel is required, the number of special keys shall be
limited to the extreme.

d) Double on-board wall

All pipe conduction through the pressure body skin, insofar as they are
in the pressure body, in non-pressure-resistant pipes and
non-pressure-resistant inncn cells, must in principle be provided with
two closures, one of which should lie directly on the board wall (see
standards of the Germaniawerft G. W. N. 130). Over board wall slipunder
NW 20 is decided on a case-by-case basis.

Allo's first on-board wall slip over NW 20 should basically be carried
out with the water pressure closing.

The Kinbau of double on-board wall absclsso is excluded in the case of
hatches and openings of similar size.

Encrypted in the open-air state of the submarine are accessible and lie
within the pressure body either directly at the pressure grain or are
connected to it by intermediate switching eimw particularly reliable
pressure-resistant pipe manifold or nozzle, can be used as simple
terminations itusgebildot, if the arrangement of double fasteners at the
relevant place encounters great difficulties or remains better out of
consideration for weight and slack.

All on-board wall closures and pressure body feeds, e.g. also for news
media, sonar systems, etc., which are exposed to external pressure, must
be fastened with expansion screws made of steel 8 G (DIN 267),
galvanized (see A3b). The screws shall be encased in reinforcement
flanges, which shall be connected to the pressure body skin by welding.
Only the best Jt plate is to be used for the packaging of all on-board
wall closures.

The handwheels and cranks of the first on-board wall ends must be marked
by balls.

All on-board wall closures, all second terminations, the intermediate
components and all reed components which can obtain external pressure or
higher operating pressures than the external pressure during normal
operation shall be designed for an operating pressure of 25 atm. They
must be sealed in a closed state against a test pressure of 32 atm and
be fixed in an open state against a test pressure of 40 atm without
licking noticeably (see also S II 6 a). If these reinforced connections
can no longer be procured in time, the previous ones used on the Type
VII C submarines can continue to be used.

In the case of the pressure test, the type of load which occurs in the
event of operation shall be imitated as far as possible, and it shall be
assessed on a case-by-case basis whether, for example, any leakage that
occurs can be regarded as permissible in view of the actual operating
conditions and the safety of the submarine and its crew.

In accordance with A. B. B. f. U, the drawings of all on-board wall
closures and pressure body feedthroughs with a diameter of 60 mm and
above must be submitted to the O.K.M. for approval before execution. In
any case, the drawing of the shipbuilding details must also be attached
to the general arrangement drawing for the individual apparatus.

For Checking the dive cell and diving bunker fittings see SH 12g. For
Inspect the components of the news systems exposed to external pressure
see S I 22e. For List of all on-board barriers see A. B. V. — U. (M)
IVc.

e) Pipelines, shut-off organs

All pipes, flanges, fittings, and associated components must be sized
according to the latest naval standards, unless difficulties in
procurement and space issues require exceptions. For the reasons of
uniformity, the number of pipe widths to be used should be limited as
far as possible, and if possible, only pipes according to standard sheet
KM 7 for copper pipes and KM 8 for steel pipes should be used.

Each closure shall be connected to a display device which is easily
readable from the control point, from which it must be clearly seen
whether the closure is vzmt or soffen. It shall be such that the pointer
wanders on the pressure body skin or the bulkhead when closing, when
opening away from it.

All iron pipes laid under the hallway and outside the pressure body
shall be galvanized inside and outside unless otherwise required for
individual pipes.

The pipelines must be laid evenly upwards as far as possible without
sharp short arcs and to avoid air bags. Good expansion options must be
considered when arranging the flanges.

All pipes and fittings must be cleaned inside and outside before they
are installed on board. Pipes that are warmly bent with sand filling
must be carefully cleaned after bending by pickling, scratching, and
blowing and otherwise appropriately from burnt sand or peeling before
installation.

The shut-off bodies and interconnectors shall be arranged in such a way
that they can be maintained during operation. All water-carrying pipes
and fittings must be able to be completely drained by leaking screws.

The cranks and handwheels shall be executed in accordance with the
existing standards.

Lubricant lines passing through the pressure body skin or through dense
walls must be blocked by a tap, which must be operated from the inside.

f) Remote drives, rods

The remote drives arranged outside the pressure body shall be provided
with particularly good lubrication devices for more important drives
(rudders, immersion cell vents, etc.) as far as possible with central
lubrication (see S II 7 a). The feed-through of the remote drives
through the pressure body skin should receive accessible stuffing bushes
that can be retracted from the inside. The remote drives are to be
provided according to the KM standard sheets (reinforced version) in
preparation at Deschimag, plant A. G. v WeserK, Bremen.

Bevel wheel transfers outside the pressure body shall be surrounded by
closed housings to be filled with consistent grease. Running parts can
be easily accessible by hand holes or flaps.

The control points of the central lubrication devices (unit system
Heliosn or De Limon Fluhme and Co.) should be operated from the inner
pressure body. Similarly, the filling of (pressure-resistant) lubricant
reservoirs arranged in the outer vessel must be able to be carried out
from the inside of the pressure body. Lubricants shall be those to be
used after the composition of the marine lubricants (currently).

About galvanizing see A4i.

For the design of cranks and handwheels, see A 4f.

g) Welding, rivets, and screwing

The components of the pressure body must in principle be connected to
each other by means of electrical welding. Electric welding must also be
used as much as possible to save weight. In general, only butt welds
without overlaps and flaps are possible.

The assembly and execution of the welds are generally governed by the
welding regulation A. B. B. II No. 4 A, 2nd draft of 10 February 1940,
for the riveting the rienere regulation A. B. B. No 9, the RM/HNA
standard sheets Ni I to 5 and the decrees subsequently issued, unless
different agreements are made in accordance with the experience of the
shipyard.

For tank welding, see S I 18 b.

When welding flanges, particular care must be taken to ensure that, to
avoid excessively high shrink age, the openings are to be cut as
precisely as possible, according to the flange diameter, and the welds
are not to be carried out thicker than prescribed.

The drawings shall specify the type and thickness of the weld and the
electrode to be used.

Special emphasis must be placed on careful execution of oil-tight parts
welding.

The circular shape of the pressure body must not be affected in any way
by the welding, and the straight main axis of the pressure body must be
preserved.

The preservation of the circular shape must be demonstrated by the
imposition of mallen with precise radius of curvature.

Welding is, if possible, also applicable to the outer nave and upper
deck. For a few other components, riveting can be used according to the
drawings in question.

Special care must be taken when welding angle profiles with an
appropriate flange due to the round edge of the web. To achieve good
welding, the round edge of the flange must be cut off. When welding
angles with an adjacent pad, the appropriate snare of the adjacent
flange must be considered.

The water-resistance of riveted parts is . basically, due to stiffening.
to deliver. Only exceptionally, sealing material may be used with the
consent of the building inspectorate.

In the execution of the welds, care must be taken to ensure that the
succession of the welds takes place in such a way that the welding
stresses in the finished component, e.g., in the case of machine
foundations and bulkheads, are reduced to as little as possible. In the
case of difficult welds, the welding sequence shall be indicated on the
drawing.

An accumulation of welds at a short distance from each other is to be
avoided. The welds for all longitudinal and transverse bandages in the
pressure body and outer vessel shall have at least 60 mm distance from
the ring and longitudinal seams of the pressure body.

When welding thin components (bulkheads, cross beams, etc.) with
considerably thicker ones (pressure bodies, pressure-resistant
bulkheads, foundation beams, etc.) a transition must be created in stump
surges by chamfering the thick parts to the thickness of the thinner
ones.

Light walls under 3 mm are to be rhened with a flat iron, which is
welded to the pressure body skin.

Where necessary, screws can be used in place of rivets, which can be
made from seawater-resistant material wherever the danger of abrosing
endangers the safety of the boat. (See A 3 a.)

h) Galvanizing, zinc protection

The rolling material of assembly S I cannot be galvanized without any
restriction. Special attention must be paid to good paint, especially
between components that are located on top of each other. Equipment,
fittings, brackets, mounting brackets on the outboard, etc. are easy to
galvanize. In addition, galvanized: iron pipes in the upper deck; and in
the biles, unless otherwise slammed.

All lighter rods and their bearings outside the pressure body shall be
galvanized or, to the extent necessary to maintain the gimgear, be made
of seawater-resistant material. During the war, the regulations on
savings must be observed.

In all cases where bronze and iron parts are permanently under seawater
in direct metallic contact, e.g. at the oars, in pipelines, etc., or
where otherwise, according to experience, edits have been found, there
is plenty of zinc protection, the design and application of which must
be carried out as uniformly as possible.

Fine zinc must be used in accordance with DIN 1706 for zinc protection
pieces. The bare metal of the zinc protection piece must be well applied
on the bare metali of the component. In the case of castings, the
connection between the protective piece and the component must be
ensured by well-directed screws.

Phosphated or rusted screws are not to be used for the connection of the
zinc protection with the component, since the phosphate and the rust
layer hinder the current transition between zinc protection, nut, screw,
and component. After each major operation of the boat, the zinc
protection flanges must be checked.

The lists of zinc protection flanges must be submitted to the O.K.M.

For Galvanizing the pipelines see A 4f.

For painting, see S IV.k Sweat water protection.

For sweat water protection, see S 117b.

i) Sound and sioßdiinmnmg.

Atte bowcglichett parts, of (only sounds or shrinkages, which allow an
ahhorehen, are to be put on swinging metail according to the war
experiences.

Visual lyrise squaportles in pipelines must certainly comply with the
highest pressures that may occur during operation in the pipes
concerned.

The vibrating motall intermediate pieces shall be tested with the
appropriate test pressure.

Likewise, sotten old display devices do) apparatuses that. sensitive to
shocks and shocks, obtain an elastic underlay or suspension.

To ensure that the protection of shock and damaged equipment and
machines against water damage is fully effective, a margin of at least 5
must now be provided between these and adjacent boat parts, etc.

For the design of the sound insulation, see A.B.V. — U. (M) IV h 5.

For marking of sound insulation with a red warning line, see S IV.

3. A5 Tests and Trials

a) General

All trials must be carried out in the presence of the building
supervision. The results of the essential trials shall be laid down in
minutes to be signed by the building inspectorate and the representative
of Battwerft.

a) Check the pressure body and the water, oil, and airtight rooms.

The pressure body and the tower incl. Very ear peeling must be tested
during construction on the Helling with an internal water pressure of 30
m pressure height via underbody pressure bodies.

Here, the pressure-resistant curved bulkheads may only be pressed from
the hollow side with 30 m water pressure.

The waterproof flat bulkheads, to prove their tightness and strength,
are designed to test pressure bodies with a water column of 1 m above
the top edge.

The pressure-resistant doors must be inspected with 7.5 and the
pressure-resistant hatch lids with 25 atm before installation in the
workshop.

All pressure-resistant and all waterproof bulkheads of the pressure body
must be tested with pressure tightness after all bulkhead passages and
bulkheads have been installed (bulkhead proof test).

The lower pressure must be generated with the space aerators. It should
be 25 mm of mercury column evenly for all Bulki-chin-sands of the
Pressure Hull, with no change in the pressure os odor of the temperature
during a test period of 10 minutes. If the scots are changed, the
pressure test must be repeated.

The results of the pressure samples of all rooms and shackles must be
entered in the bulkhead test book

To demonstrate the tightness or strength of important rooms, they shall
be tested with an internal water pressure, the pressure height of which
should correspond to the following installation:

The submersible cells 1 and 5 need to be carried out watertight only
above the flood slots to be cut after the test; below the flood slots,
they shall be made watertight only to the extent necessary to achieve
the prescribed test pressure.

The waterproof rear and the waterproof back must be pressed after the
launch with air of 200 mm water column.

The ceilings of the accumulator rooms shall be checked for tightness
with air from a pressure of 100 mm water column.

All propellant oil and engine oil leading bunkers and tanks, including
the immersive bunkers, shall also be tested with propellant oil with the
prescribed pressure after the water pressure test. The propellant
pressure must be at least 24 hours.

The facilitation of the pressure samples with 01, which was approved
during the war, is indicated (see Vfg. K I U b 1355 of 26 April 1940, K
I U b 10777 geh. v. 2 October 1940 and K I U b 10806/43 geh. v. 25 May
1943).

It is also pointed out that the graphitum coating of the bunkers etc.
does not adhere to oil-wetted iron. It is therefore recommended to swipe
with grahtum before the olpressure sample . The painting regulations of
the delivery company for bunker paints must be observed carefully.

Shafts and fittings shall be checked with the pressure to be indicated
on the drawings.

Insofar as antenna shafts are still installed, they must be checked with
an internal pressure of 5 atm water. In addition, the tightness of the
insulator mounted on the antenna shaft must be demonstrated after
installation on board by a pressure sample with an external pressure of
18 atm water. (See M, MII 19.) The results of the tests must be entered
in the Bulk Test Books.

For Inspect the components of the communication equipment exposed to
external pressure see S I 22 e.

For Checking the welds see A 5 h.

For Testing of pipelines see A 4e and S II 6 a.

For Checking the diving bunker fittings see S II 12 d and e.

b) Other tests during construction

During construction, all naval facilities must be tested. The
deficiencies resulting from these tests must be rectify.

The tower is subjected to a strength and tightness test on the delivery
plant in accordance with the special regulation of the O.K.M.

c) Inspection of the submarine

A detailed inspection of the object of delivery in all parts shall be
carried out by the building inspectorate in the presence of one or more
representatives of the shipyard prior to the handover of the submarine,
to establish once again that all the regulations relating to the
construction are complied with and that the submarine is in a clean
state sufficient for commissioning.

The underwater parts can be visited in the dock, the rudders, the flood
flaps, and the torpedo flaps are to be moved.

By leaving the outer vessel on a leash, it must be demonstrated that
nets and mine ropes cannot be stuck anywhere.

d) Trim test.

The trim test shall be carried out in accordance with A. B. B. f. U. No.
4.

After the complete appearance, the draught, which is a test descent, is
to be determined.

Based on the shipyard trim test, the submarine shall be ballasted for
provisional acceptance; a ballast sketch for the submarine must then be
drawn up.

The conformity of the entries made in this ballast sketch with the
ballast installed on board shall be certified by the building supervisor
on the ballast sketch.

The certified ballast sketch shall be handed over to the UAK at the time
of the preliminary acceptance of the submarine.

e) Attempts at cripples.

The attempt at cramping under water shall be carried out with each boat,
an attempt at overwater acreing only with the weighed boat in accordance
with A. B. B. f. U. No. 3 and No 15.

For these crane tests, the weighing books must be completed to be able
to compare the total weight of the submarine calculated from the
weighing books with the displacements calculated from the draught
measurements.

f) Pressure test, deep immerse test.

The proof of the strength and tightness of the pressure body, the tower,
the control and undershoot cells, the control bunker, the (internal)
submersible cell3 and the upper deck container for a training depth of
120 m shall be provided by means of a pressure test in the pressure dock
(relative to the lower edge of the keel) or, if the O.K.M. requires
this, by sinking the submarine to 120 m depth.

The costs of the pressure test in the pressure dock or the deep immerse
test shall not be borne by the shipyard.

g) Testing of welds.

The butt welds of the pressure body and the pressure-resistant cells
(round and longitudinal seams), the longitudinal seams of the tower
sheath and the built-up sheath (flanges, etc.) shall be examined in
accordance with the regulations on non-destructive weld testing of new
warship constructions A. B. B. II No. 4a. The results of the
investigation must be attached to the new building report in Appendix
IV.

#. A6 Main dimensions, stability, diving characteristics, crew, room layout, contents.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   a) Main dimensions

The main dimensions must be compiled separately and entered in the
booklet "Weight bill K.” See A 2 e.

b) Stability

The submarine is to be ballasted in such a way that it has no residual
buoyancy in seawater of y — 1,003 with normal payload in the sense of
the weight calculation, i.e., empty control cells and bunkers. The
visual tubes are said to have retracted.

The metacentric height in a completely submerged state, i.e., with
retracted ears, should be at least 260 mm (with 10 mm tolerance), based
on displacement at the surface.

The metacentric height on the surface should not be less than 450 mm.

The specified metacentric heights must be observed as contractual
services.

c) Diving properties

The submarine is designed for a diving depth of 120 m

The flood and ventilation devices of the submersible cells shall be
designed in such a large area that the stylish submarine, which is
ballasted in accordance with paragraph b, shall be watered in 20 seconds
during a half-length flood test with the upper deck. This time
calculates from the moment of command v rapid ventilation auH, after the
flood flaps have been opened and all outward openings of the pressure
body have been closed. The immersion cells should be shaped in such a
way that the vents, the deck beams, and stiffening’s should be arranged
in such a way that no air bubbles remain in the submersible cells and
the cells, even when diving in motion, vent completely.

d) Crew.

+------------------------------------+-------------+---------+---------+

The slat distance should generally be 600 mm. Deviations from this
division resulting from structural reasons can be found in the iron
plan.

The slat change is between D Spt. 45 and D Spt. 46. The mall edges of
the D Spanten lie in the rear aisle on the rear edge and in the foreship
on the foreedge of the spantstege.

If possible, the slats should consist of one piece. If local conditions
do not require a different position, the shock shall be arranged at the
top, according to the longitudinal seams of the pressure body
alternately on the Port and Starboard sides. In addition, the impacts of
adjacent slats should shoot about 1 m against each other.

In the area of crossbeam plates under the diesel engines D Spt. 18 to
26, the compress body braces are eliminated (see S18b).

The position of each D Spt. shock shall be visible from the pressure
body chip table. At the impact point, the slats shall be welded bluntly;
the impact points should be at least 300 mm away from the longitudinal
seams. If D Spt. are necessary, they must be reinforced. Reinforcements
for slat cut-outs must be specially marked and submitted to the 0.K.M.
for approval.

At the lowest points, the slats should receive waterway holes of 100*50
or 80-40. The watercourse holes must be welded over.

See SI 6c via the slat cut-outs over the pressure cook.

An assembly opening must be provided above the diesel engine
compartment. In the area of this opening, the D slats must be cut off.
The mounting plate must be stiffened in slat sections with the
corresponding slat profiles of the printing body. The stiffeners are to
be welded nut of the Monday epiatte (compare S 14b). Stiffeners and slat
profiles must be properly combined with double tabs and double-row
riveting. The shock joints must be the same strength as the continuous
pressure body braces construction. The drawing must be submitted to the
O.K.M.

About subdivision of the mounting plate because of the auxiliary
mounting opening see S14b.

The slats interrupted by the torpedo hatches are to be supported within
the hatches by strong, firmly fitting pressure struts. The neutral axis
should preferably lie in the axis of the ring loads. The fit of the head
ends must include the pressure body skin. The machined fittings on the
end faces of the insert beams must be attached to the head pieces of the
pressure body braces in their entire extent. The drawing of the support
is presented to the O.K.M.

If slats run through decks, cells, bunkers or tanks, the seal shall be
produced by welding.

In the case of dspanten, which pass through lateral inner bunkers or
tanks, air holes are to be placed at the highest point: they should lie
at '/g bridge height of the D Spantes, calculated from Mallkante
pressure bodies. The chippings must not be unduly weakened.

If end bulkheads of cells, etc., pass into D slats, the slats shall be
welded with the bulkhead sheets; the shock should be about 60 mm above
the cell ceiling.

b) Welding with the pressure body

For fastening the D slats to the pressure body skin, continuous welding
must be applied on both sides. For the respective apex height of the
throats, see A. B. B. II No. 4a, 2nd draft of 10 February 1940. If slats
are guided through a bunker or tank, a cell, or a dense deck, they shall
be sealed off outside the bunker, etc., about 20 mm above the ceiling in
the pressure body skin by welding, so that no oil or water can pass
between the slat and the pressure body skin.

Slat cut-outs of 50 mm width and 20 heights are to be provided above the
pressure body seams. The slats must be welded within the cut-out.S I
Group 7 Scotsman of the printing body.

c) General

The submarines are to have two pressure-resistant curved and three
waterproof flat bulkheads.

The bulkheads must be connected to the pressure body skin, or the
pressure body braces by means of continuous welding.

For the thickness of the welds see A. B. B. No. 4a 2. Draft.

If the bulkhead serves at the same time to limit bunkers or tanks,
special care must be placed on the execution of the welding.

For the final bulkhead of the dive cell 3, the torpedo and the trim
cells see SI 10b and c.

For check of the Scotsman see A 5 b.

d) Pressure bulkhead

The pressure-resistant bulkheads on D Spt. 39 and D Spt. 50 serve as a
boundary bulkhead of the headquarters. They are made of curved sheets of
15 mm wall thickness from St. 42 KM. The sheet thickness must be adhered
to as precisely as possible. The undersize may not exceed 0.5 mm in
accordance with DIN 1543. The curvature radius should be 3000 mm on the
middle ship. The edges of the Scotsman should lie in one plane. They
must be welded into a flat iron 100-20 from St. 42 KM, which is to be
welded with the pressure body skin and the diving cell cover.

In the area of the ring seam of the pressure body is on the Schott D
Spt. 50. flat iron of 140-20 mm.

The flat iron should glow normally after bending before welding. Normal
annealing may disappear if the flat iron has been ordered and delivered
as an annealed material.

In the area of the ring seam on the bulkhead 50*/g a flat iron 140 - 20
is to be used.

Each pressure bulkhead receives a pressure-resistant door with a light
diameter of 800 mm (see S II 1 b), the base angle ring of which must be
connected to the bulkhead by double-row riveting.

The openings must be milled into the bulkhead if possible. If the
openings are burned in, they shall be carried out smaller and reworked
to the required extent.

For pipes, rods and cables, special nozzles must be welded into the
bulkhead.

All fastenings of triggering bandages and all bushings and
reinforcements must be attached to the bulkheads as far as possible
before welding with the pressure body to keep the bulkhead as free from
internal stresses as possible. The openings in the bulkheads must not be
made larger than is strictly necessary.

e) Waterproof Scotsman.

The waterproof bulkheads on D Spt. 16*/., 29 and 63 are to be performed
as flat bulkheads with welded stiffeners. The bulkheads are given a
watertight door (see S II 1 b), the frame of which must be welded into
the bulkhead plating.

The bulkheads are generally 8 mm thick. The stiffeners should be so
large that they are able to wither the stresses encountered during the
testing of the Bulkhead. The transverse bulkheads limiting the battery
compartments shall be carried out so firmly that they reliably absorb
the thrust of the battery at loads of 60°.

Between the vertical stiffeners of the bulkhead D Spt. 16'/, an opening
shall be provided which allows the anchors of the E machines to be
brought through. The opening should be closed by a screwed plate. The
middle field of the bulkhead is to be moved forward in a niche way
because of the torpedo transport.

In the area of the bulkhead cans for the shaft line, the bulkhead is
particularly reinforced.

About Scots for tnnen cells, bunkers, tanks, and rooms under Fiur see
SI10.

f) Oldichte Scotsman.

About oil-tight Scots in diesel engine foundations see S18b, about drift
oil bunker bulkhead see S I lOf.

g) Light Scotsman.

The light bulkheads for the radio and the listening room are described
under SI22, for provisions, kitchen, toilet dreaming and rooms for
battery self-switches under S I 23. However, they must be weighed down
in S I 7.

4. S I Group 8 Machine carriers and other main foundations.

   a) General

Light-starting openings, hand holes and waterway holes must be cut into
the beams and support plates of the foundations. The water must be able
to run well after the bilge.

In the area of the oil tanks, the foundations are to be welded
oil-tight.

In the shaping and welding of the transverse and longitudinal wheel,
care must be taken to ensure that nowhere a notch effect cintritt, which
could lead to cracking.

The drawings of the foundations for main machines and accumulators must
be sent to the suppliers for comment and then submitted to the O.K.M.
cin.

For the thickness of the welds, see A. B. B. No. 4a 2. Draft.

b) Diesel engine foundation

The diesel engine foundations must be welded together from cross beams
and longitudinal beams to form a coherent foundation. The two inner
longitudinal beams are intercostal, the two outers continuous, the cross
beams continuously to the outer longitudinal beams to carry out.

The 12 mm thick cross beams, which are to be connected to the pressure
body skin by means of the welding, should be welded with the subsequent
D slats in such a way that a proper transition is made.

In the area of the crossbeam plates, the pressure body braces fall away
(see S 16b).

The upper edges of the cross beams shall be reinforced under the diesel
engines by welded flat irons 100 \* 10.

The 12 now thick inner longitudinal beams are welded with the bulkheads
16'/., and 29 before; desgl. the outer longitudinal beams with bulkhead
16'/... At the top edges of the inner longitudinal beams, top strips 225
\* 24 and at the top edges of the outer longitudinal beams toppleisten
210-24 shall be welded. The top strips shall be cut to 12 mm at their
free longitudinal sides and cut out to the width of the 12 now thick fan
plates or the 12 mm thick belt plates of the cross beams between the
inner longitudinal beams, so that a uniform transition from the top
strips to the lashing plates and the belt plates is created, corners are
thus avoided.

On the free longitudinal sides of the top strips, internal flat bead
irons 80-10 (from 160 - 10) must be welded downwards. However, their
fastening must be done at a distance from the outer edge in order not to
interfere with the welding of the top strips with the fan plates or with
the cross-member belts.

The cross beams between the inner longitudinal beams shall be fitted
with 12 mm thick belt plates, which shall pass as wide as possible into
the top strips and weld with them. To obtain the lowest possible welding
stresses, the belt plates must be divided into the aisle. The resulting
shock shall be welded by applied seam strips, which are welded only at
the longitudinal edges. Welding sequence when assembling in the boat:
l.Stoß Toppleiste Port with belt plate Port, Toppleiste Starboard with
belt plate Starboard. 2. Shock mittschiff by welding the seam strips;
the shock itself cannot be welded. 3. Welding the belt plates with the
cross member. The welding sequence must be tackled on the foundation
drawings.

Between the inner longitudinal beams are the dirt engine oil tank, the
engine oil collection tanks Port and Starboard and the drift oil
collection bunker. (See S 110b.) Among the diesel engines, the engine
oil tanks must be provided. The ceilings shall be 7 mm thick and shall
be placed 670 mm under mid shafts. The individual tanks are provided
with man holes, which are sealed by oil-tightly screwed lids (see S

The inner feet of the E machines should run on, 1U/. mm thick
longitudinal beams, which are to be arranged as an extension of the
inner beams of the diesel engines. They must be welded with the Schott
16*/g and intercepted at D Spt. 10. The inner longitudinal beams are
provided with 10 mm thick supports on each D slat, the upper edges of
which are to be filled with flat iron 100 - 10.

The supports between the inner beams are to be designed as foundations
for 2 air coolers of the E machines.

The longitudinal beams shall be welded with the pressure body skin, the
cross beams with the D Spain on which they are placed.

The longitudinal beams shall be cut between D Spt. 12 and 13 and D Spt.
15 and 16 for carrying out the air ducts. The lower free edges of the
longitudinal beams shall be filled with flat iron.

Flat irons 130 - 16 shall be attached to the upper edge of the
longitudinal beams for fastening the E machines.

For the support of the outer feet of the E machines, 15 welded consoles
shall be provided from D Spt. 13 to D Spt., the 11.5 mm thick
longitudinal beams of which shall be welded with the pressure body and
the D slats, and whose 15 mm thick top plates shall be provided with
hand holes for the insertion of the fastening screws.

d) Pressure lagcrfundamcntc.

The outer longitudinal beams of the pressure bearing foundations extend
from D Spt. 9 to D Spt. 11 and the inner ones from D Spt.8 to D Spt. 11.
They are made of continuous ll.5 mm sheets and welded together with
pressure body skin and the intercostal 10 mm thick cross beams.(e)
Accumulator foundations and support gels.

The accumulator foundations are to be built as open support scaffolds of
T-iron, angles and sheets and folded in stair shape according to the
installation of the accumulator cells. The scaffolds must be so strong
that they are not bent by the weight of the cells, even at inclinations
of the submarine up to 60° angle of inclination.

(f the weight and dimensions of the individual cells are concerned, see
M, MI 13.

The initiating longitudinal beam of T-profile 140- 70- 11.5 as well as
the lateral longitudinal beams from the angles 95 - 75 - 10 and 75 - 65
- 10 shall be supported with 10 mm knee plates on each D spant and
connected with the final foraves by horizontal, 8 mm thick sheets. All
components must be welded together.

The foot insulators of the accumulator cells shall be incorporated into
the longitudinal beams.

The lateral support of the cells is formed by the longitudinal bulkhead
of the propellant oil bunkers, which are particularly stiffened for this
purpose by horizontal flat ironlying between the vertical bunker
stiffeners (see SI l0f). The lateral insulators of the batteries as well
as the insulators to the front and rear are located directly on the
bunker walls or the cross-shield walls.

Short gas pipe nozzles with attached Hariwood rollers must be fitted to
accommodate the insulators, which are disordered on the front and
aaetable batteries. For lateral support see M, M I 13.

An airspace shall be provided between the cells and support scaffolds
and the longitudinal bulkheads in accordance with building regulations
M, M I 13.

For's paint for s. IV.

e) Foundations for auxiliary machines

The design of the foundations for the auxiliary machinery shall be
adapted to the stresses and local conditions; Due to greater strength
and to avoid welding with the pressure body skin, the foundations must
be attached to the D slats as far as possible.

If welds on the pressure body skin cannot be avoided, special attention
must be paid to freeing the welds from the ring and longitudinal seams.

For sound insulation when installing auxiliary machinery see [ABV —
U(M)] IV h 5.

5. S I Group 9 Platforms of the pressure hull

   a) General

Platforms or flooring floors shall be placed as running decks in all
rooms, unless otherwise required. The floorings are generally made of 3
mm thick iron caterpillar sheets and should be mounted on supporting
scaffolds from slight angles or flat irons. The fittings under the
platforms and hallways are accessible by flaps. The flaps must be
provided with hinges, pre-ruporting or tongues so that they cannot slip
out of their position in the sea. In general, the floor panels must be
connected to the scaffolding by lens seam screws.

For noise insulation, rienled on the supporting scaffolds or under the
flaps underlay strips of leather, mipolam or other replacement material,
if no other arrangements are made.

For noise reduction for gyro comptraining systems see [ABV-U (M)] !Vh5.
However, it should be noted that when depositing any the noise-absorbing
parts cannot be bridged and the storage of loads and therefore no
transmission to the on-board wall and to the water can take place.

For insulation between light metals and heavy metals, see A3b.

b) Decks above the accumulator

The accumulator spaces are to be separated from the above lying cloud
rooms by flat inner decks airtight, whose lower edge in the rear battery
compartment 50 should now lie under the main axis and in the front
battery compartment in the main axis. The ceiling of the rear battery
compartment is lowered horizontally by 225 mm on the side for the
storage of 2 compressed air bottles. The decks shall be set up in such a
way that the accumulators below are well removed and easily inspected
during operation. In doing so, a great extent of consideration must be
given to the residential facilities.

Between the end bulkheads of the accumulator spaces, under the decks, in

The decks in the toilet rooms must be waterproof. About reinforcement
among the closets see cf. SI 23b.

The Tower has an easily removable floor. The individual parts must be
brought through the tower hatch cin. The subdivision must be carried out
regarding the arrangement of the mechanical and electrical fittings. To
divert water through the Tower hatch quickly to the tower bilge, the
floor between The Central Hatch and the Periscope shaft is spared with
several drain holes.

Mipolam-Gelcnkklotz-Mattcn and Holzplattengrätinge are to be provided
for noise reduction when walking on the non-flooring panels. The grasses
must be fixed to the floor boards to avoid rattling.

Under the ground closures of the Bugiorpedorohrc, the l lur plates are
to be replaced by wood groins, so that the edges of the torpcdo
emaciating kolbcn are not damaged when weaned. The ruporter mat in the
rear torpedo room reaches up to the rear tube.

Wooden floors with linoleum bclag are to be arranged in the radio room
and in the listening room.

In the ammunition chamber, an ITolzMur floor of 30 mm thickness is to be

the passage of the air as well as for accessibility must be cut into
this support bulkhead. D Spt. 42 and 46 a shall be manufactured as frame
panels of 12 mm thickness with a belt plate 80 -12 and designed as
carriers for the flood flap drives. The D spans must be reinforced where
they are passed over the openings of the flood flaps.

A middle ship shall be installed with an intercostal longitudinal
bulkhead consisting of a 12 mm thick and 300 mm wide strip under the
cell ceiling, otherwise made of 8 mm thick sheet metal. The bulkhead is
waterproof at the ends, the very ear shafts and at the top. It should
get below waterway holes. On D Spt. 41, 43, 46, 47 and 48 flat bead
irons 100 - 8 should be provided. A flat iron 90-10 shall be welded to
the two submersible terminal bulkheads, which shall be provided with
long holes so that the longitudinal bulkhead can be screwed to the final
bulkheads in such a way that it cannot act as an anchor. A pack shall be
placed between longitudinal bulkhead and flat iron strips.

Between D Spt. 45 and D Spt. 46 an airtight screwed manhole 300 - 400 is
to be arranged in the longitudinal bulkhead, which can be opened from
Starboard.

The end bulkheads are to be carried out as pressure-resistant bulkheads
of 20 mm wall thickness, which are curved in the radial cross-section in
an elliptical shape according to the O. K M. At the edge they are
provided with a flange. The connection of the final bulkhead With. the
surrounding components should be carried out by oil-tight chain riveting
with 25 mm rienest diameter. To obtain a stem edge on the curved side of
the end bulkhead, a wedge must be welded on the flange outside. The
bulkhead is then expedient ly turned off to the main diameter.

The final bulkhead and the submersible cell ceiling as well as their
stiffenings are to be made from St. 52 KM, the central longitudinal
bulkhead from St. 42 KM.

c) Trim and torpedo cells

The trim and torpedo cells are in both end spaces of the pressure body.

The rear Trim cell ranges from D Spt. \*/, to about D Spt. 4'/, and has
a downward curved, 10 mm thick ceiling with a radius of curvature of 2
000 mm and an internal deck beam made of flat bead profiles 130 - 7.
Both end bulkheads are 10 mm thick. The rear end bulkhead is flat and
with 2 stiffeners made of flat bead iron 80 - 7, the front with a
curvature radius of 1 500 mm to be carried out without stiffening.

The rear torpedo cell lies directly in front of the trim cell and
reaches up to D Spt. 7*/s- It must be used in two parts to be able to
store the reserve torpedo under the aisle. Each half of the cell has an
upward curved 8 mm thick ceiling with a curvature radius of 1,055 mm. On
D Spt. 6, a built support bulkhead must be provided, which must be stuck
through the ceiling to achieve reliable welding. The front, 8 mm thick
end bulkheads should have a curvature radius of 1 500 mm. They are not
too stiffened.

The front torpedo cells 2 and 3 range from D Spt. 63 to 260 mm before D
Spt. 69. They shall be separated by a flat longitudinal bulkhead, which
shall be pressure-resistant against 3 atm. It is followed forward to D
Spt. 73, the front trim cell. All three cells shall have a common,
downward curved, 10 mm thick ceiling with a radius of curvature of 3 000
mm mid ship and one of 650 mm on the sides. The ceiling must be brought
to the pressure body skin through 12 mm thick edge plates and welded
with it. The ceiling is to be stiffened with internal deck beams made of
flat iron 140 mm x 10 mm on each slat and in between flat iron slats
70*10.

The 10 mm thick end bulkheads of the torpedo cells shall be carried out
as outwardly curved bulkheads with a radius of 1 500 mm, which shall be
welded with the pressure body skin and the cell ceiling. The front 12 mm
thick bulkhead of the trim cell must be flattened and provided with
stiffeners made of flat bead iron 100-9 zn.

The D slats passing through the cell ceiling are easy to weld with it
and connected to the deck beams by knee sheets. The intermediate flat
irons do not get any connection with the pressure body skin.

For torpedo cell as washing water cell see S II 0d.

For torpedo cells 1 and 3 as drift oil bunkers see S II 0f and S II 6c.

d) Drinking water cells and washing water cell

In the battery rooms, in the central office and in the front living
room, 3 drinking water cells as well as 'a fourth cell, which is only
designated as a washing water cell, are to be installed, w egen at the
drift oil bunker. Drinking water cell 1 lies on Port from D Spt. 29 to
about D Spt. 31 under corridor and then has a niche of about 480 mm
length and 1 175 mm width from D Spt. 29 to D Spt. 30. Cell 2 is on D
Spt. 42*/, up to D Spt. 44 on Port over corridor, line 3 on about D Spt.
55'/, up to D Spt. 58'/' Starboard. The washing water cell is located
under corridor on about D Spt. 53 to D Spt. 54 starboard, between the
room for T-Devicec and the drift oil bunker 2. The walls of the cells
must be welded with the adjacent components.

In addition, the torpedo cells 1 and 2 are to be set up for freshwater
over- and-remover-, to be able to use the cells as washing water cells.

e) Dirty water cells

In both accumulator rooms, one dirty water cell is to be ordered and
connected to the bilge line. Both cells lie on Port under corridor, cell
1 about D Spt. 31 to D Spt. 32 and cell 2 D Spt. 53 to about D Spt. 54.

f) Drift oil bunker

The drift oil bunkers are located on the side of the rooms in front of
and behind the headquarters. They are connected by each cross bunker in
front of or behind the final bulkheads of the inner submersible cell.

The propellant oil bunker 1 reaches at the Starboard side in its lower
part from D Spt. 29 to D Spt. 41 and in its upper part from about 100 mm
behind D Spt. 32 to the central bulkhead 39; on the port side at the
bottom and above from about 100 mm behind D Spt. 32 to D Spt. 41 or
Schott 39.

The clear width between the two longitudinal bulkheads, which are
perimated vertically from bottom to top, is 2 440 mm. Both longitudinal
bunkers are connected by a cross bunker located only below the corridor,
the rear cross-bulkhead is 100 mm in front of D Spt. 38 and whose front
boundary forms the diving cell end bulkhead. The ceiling of the
transverse bunker is formed by the extended ceiling of the dive cell 3.

The drift oil bunker 2 ranges from the front dive cell end Schott 48 to
Schott 63. The clear width between the two longitudinal bulkheads is
also 2440 mm. The front boundary of the cross bunker is a bulkhead 200
mm behind D Spt. 51. The ceiling of the drift oil bunker 2 is generally
located at the height of the main axis, which is formed by the extended
submersible cell ceiling, which here is only 15 mm thick, as in bunker
1. The ceiling of the side bunkers is raised on the starboard side from
about D Spt. 55*/, to 61%, on the Port side from about D Spt. 52 to 61%
by 350 mm above main axis. For better flow of sweat water, the ceilings
must be laid on the side with a little fall. To drain the sweat water
from the ceiling of the propellant oil bunker in the officer's room, the
longitudinal walls are to be led about 15 mm over the ceilings.

The longitudinal and transverse bulkheads are made of 7.5 mm sheets at
the bottom and 7 mm sheets at the top. The longitudinal bulkheads shall
be stiffened on each D Spt. by flat bead iron 100 - 8 and intercepted by
horizontal anchors made of flat bead iron 100 - 7 against the pressure
body braces. The flat bead irons on the longitudinal walls next to the
flat and battery compartment at the front must be welded continuously
from above to under the ammunition compartment ceiling for better
absorption of the clamping torques. The cross-scotts are to be stiffened
in the sense. The Bulkheads must be so strong that they can safely
absorb the thrust of the battery, which is produced at loads of up to
60° and in the case of crimping up to 60°. The longitudinal bulkheads
are to be provided with a stretchfold just before Schott D Spt. 63.

The fields between the vertical stiffeners shall be stiffened by
horizontally arranged flat iron saly at 75*8, the distances in the
battery cells are based on the position of the insulators, since these
flat irons serve at the same time for the lateral support of the battery
cells.

The propellant oil bunkers must be completely welded. Welding to Schott
63 is besondereSorgfa.lt, as experience shows that there are frequent
leaks here, so it is thicker than normal to be carried out. The D spans
in the bunkers are continuous. They are oil-tight to weld with the
intercostal edge plates.

During construction, care must be taken to ensure that the vent holes in
the pressure body panels of the inner bunkers are installed exactly
according to the drawing. The air holes should be arranged approximately
at % web height D Spt. from Mallkante pressure body skin and as high as
possible. The spant profile must not be unduly weakened. Residual air
must be removed by appropriate trimming and cruising (cf. SI 6b). The
bunkers are provided with oil-tight screwed manholes, which must be
accessible without undue work.

Torpedo times 1 and 3 should be set up for the temporary absorption of
propellant oil (see S116c).

g) Engine oil storage tanks

In the diesel engine foundation, 26 engine oil tanks are to be installed
from D Spt. 18 under the diesel engines and from D Spt. 19 to D Spt. on
the side (see S J8b).

h) Motorcnölsannneltanks, dirt engine oil tank and drift oil collection
   bunker.

In the area of the diesel engine foundation, the mulch engine oil tank,
the two engine oil collection tanks, and the Fuel oil collection bunker
are to be ordered. Side walls, ceilings and cross-shields are formed by
the diesel engine fundainente (see S I 8b).

For each tank and the bunker, a special manhole is to be provided, which
is to be closed oil-tightly by a lid. The two engine oil tanks must be
used from each engine oil collection tank.

i) Distillate containers

In the e-machine room midship between D Spt. 11 and D Spt. 12 and
between D Spt. 14 and D Spt. 15, six loose containers for distillate of
a total of about 0.5 cbm are to be arranged under the reserve torpedo
for filling the accumulator scrimps (see SH 17s and see M, MH 17).

j) Accumulators

The rear battery compartment, battery compartment 1, is between D Spt.
29 and on Port Side between 100mm behind D Spt.30 and Schott 100mm in
front of D Spt.38, the front, battery compartment 2, between D Spt. 53%
and D Spt. 54'/., and D Spt. 63.

Limitations: Waterproof Scots see S I 7,

Drinking water cell and washing water cell see S I 10d, ski-use water
cell see S I 10e, bunker bulkhead see S I l0f,

Battery blankets see S I 9 b,

Room for T-devices see S I 10 m.

k) Ammunition chamber

The ammunition chamber ranges from Bunker querschot 50 to D Spt. 53 and
is bounded to the side by the bunker longitudinal bulkhead (see S I
l0f). The 5mm thick Schott 53 is made by two horizontals, with a lying.
Flange on sifted angle 60-40'5 and two vertical flat irons 50-6
stiffened, which lie 350 mm from center ship and run to the upper
stiffener.

To hold the ammunition weight sufficiently strong, flanged floor
wrangles must be welded on the D Spanhm, on which the hallway bodcn is
to be fixed (see S I 9a).

For ammunition chamber decks, see S I 9c.

l) Room for T-devices

The space for T-devices ranges from the front ammunition room bulkhead
53 to 30mtn before D Spt. 54%. Its lateral boundary is 705 mm from
center Shia on both sides. The 5 mm thick cross bulkhead 54% is welded
by three horizontals, with a standing flange welded! 65-50-8 and
vertically placed 425mm from center ship lying flat iron 60-8 stiffened.
The angles are used at the same time for the AhS IIitzcn of the battery
battery in front of it. The 5 mm thick longitudinal bulkhead are
stiffened by the adjacent water cell bulkhead and three horizontal flat
irons 60-8, which at the same time absorb the support pressure of the
battery cells.

The ceiling of the room for T-devices should be given an assembly flat
and in it a duct that can be locked by a hatch lid (see S19d and SH Id).

7. S I Group 11 Skin of the Outer Hull

   a) General

The outer skin is the outer boundary of the waterproof stern, the diving
cells, the immersive bunkers, the pressure-resistant cells, the
waterproof baking, and the flooded rooms. It extends in the back ship in
front hintcrstem to about Spt. 12, in the aisle from about Spt. 92 to
the Vorstem. From about Spt. 20 to about Spt. 79 is, independent of the
for- and hinterschifl', a lateral extension arranged, which forms in the
rear part the diving bunker 2, in the middle part the control bunker,
the control cell and the understatement cell and in the front part the
diving bunker 4.

At the ends, the annex contains flooded rooms to create a good
transition into the ship's shape.

All cells, bunkers and waterproof spaces in the outer nave are easily
accessible by manholes.

The flooded rooms must have enough large flood and vent openings. They
are fitted with screwed plates, man holes or hand holes for the
maintenance of the components and for the after-inspection of fittings.

The side cover of the upper deck is S I 15d.

b) Exterior

The plating of the outer skin is generally to be carried out around the
diving cells, the waterproof stern, and the waterproof back 5 mm, around
the immersion bunker 6 mm, around the flooded rooms 4 mm, in front of
diving bunker 4 but 5 mm thick.

In the area of the control bunker, the control cell and the
understatement cell, the outer skin is formed by the plating of these
pressure-resistant spaces.

In places where local stress occurs, e.g., at the passage points of the
front depth rudders, the flood flaps, and the anchor vents, and in other
places that arise during the preparation of the drawings, the outer skin
shall be strengthened in an appropriate manner; duplications should be
avoided.

The impacts in the individual gears of the outer skin must be bluntly
connected by V-welding. The longitudinal seams should generally be
connected by riveting, but in the immersion bunkers and flood slots
bluntly by V-welding.

In the area of the flooded rooms, the outer skin must be riveted as far
as possible with the outer panels. VeT-screwed plates should only be
used where this is necessary because of the construction and maintenance
of the components. Continuous wedges for fastening the screwed plates
must be avoided.

To prevent loose objects from falling from the upper deck into the
flooded space between the outer skin and the pressure body, perforated
sheets or wire meshes shall be installed where necessary.

In the flooded rooms, a waterproof riveting is not required, in the
immersion cells below the flood slots only to the extent necessary for
the proper testing of the cells.

c) Cell and bunker ceilings

About the cell ceiling of the waterproof rear and the waterproof back
see S I 15d.

The cell ceiling of submersible cell 1 runs from the torpedo support
bulkhead Spt. —9 to 200 mm behind Spt. —2 about 8° ascending to almost
below the upper deck and from there from the edge of the tauchzelle
horizontally. To build the rudder drive that enters the outer ship
between Spt. 2 and Spt. 3 is a niche that is too open forward. Through
the rear wall of the niche and through the submersible cell and diving
cell ceiling, two pipes are to be welded waterproof to the rear, through
which the push rods of the rudder drive are to be guided. The niche must
be provided with a wire mesh at the front to prevent foreign bodies.

The cell ceiling of submersible cell 1 and the niche plating are
generally

6 mm thick and stiffen through external beams. The cell ceiling receives
a partly riveted, partly welded mounting opening of about 2 000-700 mm
light width for inserting the rear torpedo tube shot.

The longitudinal seams and impacts of the cell ceilings and niche sheets
shall be connected by V-welding; the cell ceiling and the outer skin
must also be welded together.

The submersible cell 5 is to obtain a front sloping ceiling of 6 mm
thickness, which is to be stiffened by beams lying on the ceiling and
underlying longitudinal beams.

The 5 mm thick ceiling of the waterproof back drops from the upper deck
Spt. 103 forward with about 6° inclination to Schott 113. Deck beams and
longitudinal beams shall be placed on the cell ceiling as far as
possible. All connections must be welded.

d) Edge plate

The immersive bunkers shall be provided on the side to the pressure body
with edge plates of 6 mm thickness, which shall be radially fed to the
pressure body. The edge plates shall be laid in such a way that their
weld seam is free from the pressure body seams at least 60 mm.

For drainage of the edge plate niche see S II 12, 3 a.

8. S I Group 12 Stem and Wave Cutters

   a) Rear stem

The rear stem shall be made of cast steel; it lies with its lower edge
1400 mm above base. It must be made as a box with ribs, which must be
given enough waterway holes. The rear end of the Stems is to be
sharpened for a good water run-off. In the lower part, two bearing
nozzles for storage and warts for lubrication of the rear deep rudder
shaft, and two stop surfaces for the end positions of the deep rudder
lever are to be poured inside.

For Location of the rear deep rudder shaft see S I 13d.

For rudder angle see S I 13 b.

For the insertion of the push rods of the rear deep rudder drive and for
the assembly of the bolts for the rudder lever, hand holes shall be
provided, which must be screwed water tightly, as far as they lie above
the flood slots of the submersible cell.

The hind stem must be provided with a spooning for the connection with
the outer skin and the :mark:`deadwood shoe` and connected to the outer
skin by chain or zigzag riveting.

b) Dead wood shoe and hoe

The dead wood shoe is made of cast steel (see A 3 h). It should form the
connection between your stern stem and the wave bucks and range from
about Spt. —5 to Spt. —2. The deadwood shoe is easy to overlap with the
back stem and the U-iron 240-95-12-15,5, which represents the extension
of the sole of the dead wood shoe forward. To fasten the slats with the
lotholzshoe, ribs shall be provided on the other side, as well as on
both sides between Spt.—4and Spt.—3 casts for fastening the shaft bucks.

A hoe must be affixed under the deadwood shoe, which must be poured from
one piece with the lotwood shoe. The hoe must be trained as a full
support column. It should be given a consistent cross-section that is
favorable for water resistance. The lower edge hoe sole should lie 200
mm above base, be widened, and receive sponung sprues for the attachment
of rejects to the rear and front.

The forward-looking rejecter is to be led as a strong rod of round
cross-section to about Spt. 1 and to be stiffened on about half a length
by a strut of water-cut cross-section against the dead wood.

For's rudder-like repellators see ST 13f.

c) Wellenböcke – Propeller Shaft Brackets

The screw shafts are to be stored at the back in two-armed shaft blocks
made of cast steel (see A 3 b), whose arms are to be given a favorable
shape for the water resistance. The upper arms of the wave bucks are to
be riveted between Spt. — 4 and Spt. —3 by powerful flanges with the
stringer in submersible cell 1. The rear aisle must be reinforced at
this point by frame clips. The lower arms should be well connected with
the sprues provided for this purpose by three rows of rivets. The arms
must be widened at these lashing points. On the nabs, rags for fastening
the mine shields for the rear depth rudders ' and the screws must be
provided. The lobes must have good transitions to the nabs and must not
have sharp notches caused by the machining.

For the location of the center waves see M, M I 7.

d) Wave outlet nozzles

The stern tubes shall be stored between D Spt. 3 to D Spt. 4 and about D
Spt. 7 in cast iron nozzles. The front nozzle is in the torpedo cell end
bulkhead. To it is followed to the rear a gradually leaking
pressure-resistant hollow of 16 now thick sheet metal, which is to be
welded into the pressure body skin. The rear nozzle should be welded
with the pressure body skin by poured webs.

Subsequently to the pressure-resistant trough, a light covering of 5 mm
sheet metal must be provided outside the pressure body around the Stem
tube. A slender, lightweight cover cap is placed on the rear nozzle,
which is easy to screw with the outer skin. The screws of the cover caps
must be secured by grain stroke.

e) Stem

The stem should give the lines cntSpt.echend a smooth, round shape, so
that troughs cannot hook on it. It should consist of three welded parts,
of which the upper and middle ones are made of steel casting (see A3b).
Vent holes must be provided. The lower part can be made from St 42 KM.

The upper part should run out on the upper deck into an open tow rail
and get an eye to attach the front antenna. The eye must run forward in
a slender shape, so that mine, anchor, ropes etc. cannot hook. The lower
part of the stem is to be trained as a :mark:`Stem shoe`. The upper part
shall be provided with a sponing for the start-up of the outer skin. The
outer skin is to be connected to the Stem by zigzag rhening.

9. S I Group 13 Rudder and Rudder Protection

   a) General

The boat is to have two rudders lying with the rudder axis in the same
slat plane as well as a front and a rear pair of deep rudders.

All rudders are to be carried out as balance rudders in a form favorable
for water resistance. The rudder blades are to be built as displacement
rudders; the deep rudder blades should consist :mark:`of
ellipiconically` twisted steel casting with cast cloths and hereon
welded arms with double-sided plating. The rudder blades are provided
with ribs, which receive relief holes. The longitudinal ribs must be
welded directly with the rejuvenated rudder shafts. The space between
the plating is well filled with wood and marine glue on all rudder
blades. To protect the wood filling from swelling, the plating at its
edges must be welded waterproof on all sides. To demonstrate the
tightness, all rudder blades must be checked at 0.3 kg/cm air pressure
and the result of the test shall be entered in the bulkhead test book.

All rudder blades are removable. They must be taken care of closely on
the conical lyses, as well as the fastening springs for the rudder
blades and for the drive levers; the nuts must be provided with a double
fuse. The nabs of all rudder bodies should each receive a threaded screw
hole with normal thread for attaching a push-down screw for pulling the
rudder blades off the rudder shafts. The same push-off screw shall be
provided for all rudders. To be able to apply and tighten the fastening
nut or the push-off screw on the rudder shaft or on the rudder shaft, a
correspondingly large, screwed hand hole must be placed in the plating.
The hand hole should lie at the deep rudders on the top, at the rudders
on the outer side of the plating.

The space under the hand hole must be separated from the rest of the
rudder blade space on all sides by waterproof welding. The surfaces and
edges of the rudder blades shall be smooth.

Pins for storage in the screw guard shall be attached to the outer edges
of the rear deep rudder blades in the rotary axis. Likewise, pins for
the storage of deflector rods shall be attached to the lower edge of the
rudder in the rotary axis. The shape of the fuse plate for the fastening
of the debar rods shall be chosen in such a way that, in addition to
reliable securing of the nuts, all slots are covered when the rudder
blades are placed in the hard layers, so that mine ropes and net troughs
cannot hook.

All bearings and other friction points of the entire rudder equipment
shall be connected to the central grease lubrication systems in the
front and rear aisles. For the parts of the rudder device lying outside
the pressure body, the lubrication devices are particularly plentiful
(see A4g).

Zinc protection panels must be affixed where the experience gained is
required (see A4i).

Similar rudders and rudder shafts should be interchangeable on all type
VIIC, VII D and VII F boats. For the length dimensions and diameter of
the rudder shafts, the rudder bearings and for the cone in the rudder
blades, stencils or gauges are produced in such large numbers that each
replica or work which produces rudder shafts, rudder castings or
bearings has a complete set of stencils or gauges available. The length
dimensions

Drawings of the rudders, rudder shafts and bearings in the submarine
shall be submitted for approval.

The rudder shafts or shafts shall be drilled as far as possible for
weight relief. The rudder shafts of the front and rear depth rudders
should be pulled to the same side (Port).

For facilities for rudders and over rudder lines see S II 7. m\ :sup:`2`

b) Rudder and Rudder Protections

The rudders should each have an area of about 2.75 m. The axis of
rotation should divide the blade length of about 1400inm in the ratio 1
:.3. The leaf length is the connecting line of the center of the front
and rear edge of the leaf.

The rear depth rudders should each have an area of about 2.25 m, the
front depth rudders should each have an area of about 2.40 m.

For the rear deep rudders, the rudder blade length of 1225 mm,
determined in the same way as for the rudders, shall be divided in the
ratio 860 : 365.

In the front depth rudders, there should be about 1.65 m behind the axis
of rotation and 0.75 m\ :sup:`2` rudder surface in front of the axis of
rotation, i.e. it should not be more than the entire rudder surface in
front of the axis of rotation.

For the front depth rudders, only the specified area ratio is decisive.

The rudders should receive the following rashes:

Rudder: total rudder rash and naval rudder stop 30° on each side; End
layer shut-off is set to 28° on each side.

Rear deep rudder: total rudder rash and naval rudder stop 30° up and
down; Limit position switch set to 28° top and bottom.

Front depth rudder: total rudder rash and navigable rudder stop 25°
upwards and 35° downwards; Limit position switch set to 23° upwards and
33° downwards.

The red marks on the scales of the ifuder hands must be placed 2° before
setting the limit position switch or 4° before the naval rudder stop.

The naval rudder stops must not be allowed to precede on the outside.

In the end positions, only the fixed rudder stops and not the drive
parts of the rudder rods may come to the plant. For the depth rudders,
the lever sitting on the shafts should receive the lifting limit.

Rudder.

The rudders are 225 mm behind the torpedo tube support bulkhead Spt.—9
and 620 mm each from the center ship. Each rudder must be led to the
eighth edge of the torpedo tube support headboard at the bottom of a
heavy, barbed steel casting bearing. For the upper end of the rudder
shaft, a support and neck bearing made of cast steel must also be
provided.

Both bearings are in the flooded, watertight-lined niche behind the
torpedo tube support bulkhead Spt. —9. They must relate to the outer
skin, the bulkhead Spt. -—9 and the adjacent components so that the
rudder pressures are safely absorbed by the components of the rear
aisle. The rudder shafts are to be forged from St C 35 KM. They should
have a diameter of 215 mm in the ­lower support bearing and the other
dimensions according to the drawing. Each rudder shaft should receive a
thread at the top in which an eye-pin can be inserted.

Single-armed, two-piece rudder levers, initially forged from St C 35 KM,
must be carefully taken care of on the cones at the upper end of the
rudder shafts and fastened by means of springs (see S II 7 a).

To protect against basic contact, the lower edges of the rudder blades
must be about 1000 mm above the base.

c) Depth rudder.

The rear depth rudders are located behind the screws 1750 mm above the
base and 3245 mm behind D Spt. 0. Their shaft must be stored in the
intended sprues at the rear stem (see S I 12a).

The front depth rudders shall be arranged on Spt. 100 (1200 mm in front
of the reference edge of the front bottom, 1500 mm above base) below the
torpedo tubes. Their shaft shall be stored in steel castings, which are
easy to attach in submersible cell 5 by frame clips and stringers.

The bearings of the front deep rudder shaft are to receive stuffing
bushes, which can be retracted from the inside of the submersible cell.
In the area of the steel castings, the outer skin must be reinforced
(see S I 11 b).

The rudder shaft common for both rudder blades of a deep rudder pair is
to be made from St C 35 KM. On each shaft a two-part rudder lever made
of St C 35 KM is to be placed. The hat nuts of the deep rudder shafts
are made of steel.

The smallest diameter in the cylindrical parts is 155 mm for the rear
depth rudder shaft and 167 mm for the front. The starboard bearings
(smallest diameter within the bearing points) should be 157 mm in
diameter for the rear deep rudder shaft and 170 mm in diameter for the
front deep rudder shaft.

The springs of the rudder shafts are particularly well matched.

The weight torque of the deep rudder leaves is to be compensated by iron
ballast in the front part of the leaves considering the
self-displacement.

d) Manual rudder drive.

All rudders must be driven electrically, but manual drive must also be
provided.

For the electric drive of the rudders, see M, MII 1.

Above rudder stands see S 11 7 b.

For hand rudder lines, see S II 7 c.

The drive of the rudders shall be led upwards between D Spt. 1 and 2
through the pressure body. On the vertical feed-through shaft, a lever
of 330 mm radius shall be attached within the pressure body, above the
pressure body a double lever with a radius of 400 mm on both sides. The
transfer from the double lever to the single-arm levers with 400 mm
radius, which sit on the rope rudder shafts, is to be carried out by two
long push rods made of seamless steel tube.

The rear deep rudder drive passes through the pressure body through the
rear end floor. The passage point is 680 mm above the main axis and 600
mm after the Starboard side from the center ship. Behind the rear end
bottom, between Spt. —1 and Spt. —2, an intermediate shaft is arranged,
on which two single-armed levers of 425 mm radius sit offset by 180°.
The push rods for the rear deep rudder drive attack at the lever ends.

The passage of the front deep rudder drive should take place at about D
Spt. 78 to D Spt. 79 through the lower part of the front pressure body
shot. For this purpose, an outlet nozzle must be placed, which shall be
poured from cast steel.

e) Rudder protection.

The rear depth rudders and at the same time the screws must be protected
by fixed transpellen made of steel casting, which are to be attached to
the shaft blocks at shaft height and stored in the rotary pins of the
depth rudders (see SI 12e).

The front depth rudders must be protected forward by narrow, fin-like,
built, solid deflectors, which must have a favorable shape for
overcoming the water resistance. They are to be built from cast steel
and slabs waterproof and filled with concrete or tarred wood before
installation. A dreli cone on the outer edges of the front-facing deep
rudder blades for storage in the rejector is not to be provided. They
should point upwards against the balance rights by about 5°, i.e. high
in the front.

To indicate the position of the depth rudders and screws, a 40 mm wide
color screed must be applied to the wooden deck in the screws and the
rear and front depth rudders. In addition, a clearly visible strip of
paint without inscription must be attached to the side of the upper
deck.

To protect the rudders, especially for basic touches, a hoe should be
provided (see SI 12b).

From the hoe, one arm of round cross-section shall be led to the two
rudders and stored at these cones. The arms shall be spread by a
crossbar of water-cut cross-section in such a way that the guide eyes of
the arms are easily attached to the rudder pins and thus rattling noises
are avoided. The crossbar must therefore be welded in during the
assembly of the rod on board.

All fixed dflectors shall be subdivided or ordered in such a way that a
slight

removal of the rudder blades and pulling of the rudder shafts is
ensured. At Vor­

drive to the east may mine dew or networks at the oars or their
designers do not catch hook; therefore, special attention must be paid
to smooth execution of all transitions everywhere.

10. SI Group 14 Slats, bulkheads, longitudinal bandages, and platforms
    of the outer vessel

    a) General

The span distance in the outer nave should generally be 500 mm.
Deviations from this can be seen from the iron plan.

The dressings and other fittings in the waterproof rear, in the
immersion cells, in the waterproof back and under the upper deck shall
be placed in such a way that a rapid and complete ventilation and
complete drainage can take place, the latter as far as the position of
the flood folds permits. Where necessary, vents and drainage openings
shall be cut in such a way as to weaken the strength of the dressings as
little as possible, since a necessarily sea-resistant construction must
be ensured.

Local reinforcements of the normal associations, apart from the
reinforcements listed in this group, shall also be met elsewhere in all
places which are subject to stress.

All stringers and beams must be provided with relief holes where
connected.

The aim is to weld all longitudinal and transverse bandages. All welded
joints of the outer vessel with the pressure body shall be carried out
with a continuous throat. The transitions from one bandage to the other
are to be mediated by appropriate knee plates. The reference edge at the
rear end floor is Mallikante Spt.0 (as well as Mallkante D Spt.0).
4)Spant change is in the pressure-resistant outer cell. The flanges of
the outer braces strike in the back aisle forward, in the foreship,
rear.

b) Slats and deck bars

The slats in the outer nave are to be made from Angle Iron 60x40x5mm,
bent knee plates are attached to the top and bottom of the pressure
body. In the dive cells 1 and 5 they are to be riveted with the outer
skin by 13 now rivets at 6 d distance, in the dive bunkers 2 and 4 with
a standing flange to weld with the outer skin. In the area of the flood
flaps, the braces must be brought to the frames of the flaps and
stiffened against the pressure body by anchor and knee plates to achieve
a particularly good support of the flap frames. The slats are to be
supported against the pressure body at the height of the stringer on
each second slat, above it on each slat by support struts 50 - 50-6 mm
or 40-40-5 mm. The struts must be attached to knee sheets, which are to
be welded with the pressure body skin.

The deck beams in the fore and rear aisle should generally consist of
angles 60-40-5, placed on the cell ceiling and welded with it with
proscoming flange.

In the rear aisle, the slats —6, —4and —3 shall be made in depth rudders
and shaft bucks as 5- and 6-mm frame braces of about 175 mm in height,
respectively; Spant angle 50 - 50 - 6, belt 70-8. For the unhindered
passage of the air, the upper parts of the frame panels on the cell
ceiling must be placed. The. Frame clips must be carefully connected to
the cell ceiling and stringers.

On each slat, between the lower strings, in general, 7 mm thick floor
wrangrows are to be placed, which are to be provided with large openings
for the passage of the water. Slats, which are more stressed by special
loads, such as corrugated buck fastening and deep rudder intermediate
bearings, receive 9 mm thick floor wrangling. To accommodate the shear
forces occurring in the intermediate bearing, the ground wrangrows —3 to
0 shall be well connected by two intercostal longitudinal beams, which,
however, are not to be brought to the pressure body. The floor wrangling
of the dead wood shall be 9 mm thick and from Spt. 0 7 mm thick. The
floor wrappers shall be riveted with the cross ribs of the hind-stem and
the dead woodshoe (see S112b) and connected by angle 75 - 75 - 10 with
the 10 or 8 mm thick outer skin of the dead wood shoe. The sole of the
dead wood consists in the extension of the dead wood shoe made of a
U-iron 240-95 - 12- 15.5. It lies horizontally 1400 mm above base and
approaches the pressure body at about Spt. 7.

In the aisle, where necessary, the slats must be reinforced and ground
wrangling

mm thick and from Spt. 93 5 mm thick on each slat. They must be fitted
with a belt or flange. The ground wrangrows are well connected to the
central keel carrier.

In the dive cell 5, in the flood slots transversely standing impact
plates between the slat feet on Spt. 93, 54, 95 and 96 are to be screwed
up. The sheets should be 5 mm thick and smooth and reach up to about 250
mm above the adjacent top flood slots.

These impact plates are intended to limit the vortex formation of the
water pressed through the flow into the diving cllc during overwater
travel and the mixing of this water with the air in the cell.

In the Spantfeldcrn 92/93, 93/94 and 95/96 no flood slits are cintociden
above the longitudinal seam of the Outer slabs.

In the area of the bearings of the front depth rudder, Spt. 99 and 100
shall be carried out as 5 mm and 6 mm thick and 175 mm high frame
panels. Spt. 98 is, as far as the accessibility of the submersible cell
allows, to be reinforced by supports against the front end floor. The
ground wrange on Spt. 100 must be amplify locally to compensate for the
weakening caused by the cut-out for the deep rudder hebcl cintritt.

c) Middle keel carrier

The aisle receives a 10 mm in extension of the sittelke plate (see S I
24 a) from D Spt. 68'/2 to Spt. 91*/2 and an 8 mm thick central keel
carrier from Spt.0D/gbis Spt.lO3*L, which is to be welded with the
pressure body to the front end floor. Before Spt. 103-0, the middle keel
carrier 6 is now thick lynot.

Before Spt. 97 to Spt. 106, the free top edge of the carrier must be
provided with a top bar 100-10.

The middle keel carrier must be welded with the keel shoe plate or with
the Vorstem.

d) Stringer

To support the rear aisle and to fasten the shaft buck arms, a lower
heavy stringer (Stringer 1) must be placed from Spt.—6 to Npt 2, which
must be riveted with the outer skin at an angle 75 - 75 - 10 and welded
with the bottom wrangles that reach up to it. It must be fed to the end
bottom and up to Spl 2 to the pressure body skin hcran. Its width
depends on local conditions. In the area of the shaft bucks from Spt.
—6to Spt. —3, the stringer is 12 mm, before that 9 mm thick. It shall be
fitted with a belt 100-15.

Approximately at the widest point of submersible cell 1 is from torpedo
tube support schott —9 also to Spt. 2 another stringer (Stringer 2) with
support plates to arrange on each spant. From Spt. —9 to Spt. —it must
be carried out 5 mm thick and at least 250 mm wide; before Spt. —2 it
must be taken 6 mm thick and widened to the pressure body skin. Its belt
should be made of flat iron, about 70-8. The string egg plate must be
welded with the outer skin and the pressure body skin.

In the waterproof rear, a light 5 mm thick stringer (Stringer 3) of 150
mm web height and a belt of about 60-8 must be provided from Spt.—15 to
Spt.—8, which must be connected to the slats by small support plates and
welded to the outer skin. In extension of Stringer 3, an angle 60-40-5
is to be placed as stiffening of the outer skin (Stringer 4) until the
edge of the submersible cell 1.

In the dive bunker 2 and 4 a stringer of about 175 mm width is to be
installed about in the wide width of the submarine. The 5 mm thick
sheets must be welded with the outer skin and provided with a belt of
about 60 - 8 on the inner soap. They must be fed up to the bulkhead of
the pressure-resistant Außcnzellcn hcran. At the ends, the stringers
should run out narrower.

The screwed sheets in front of and behind the immersive bunkers are to
be reinforced in the steak of the stringer by high-edged welded flat
irons 60 - 8.

In the aisle, two stringers shall be incorporated below the ceiling of
the submersible cell 5, of which the lower stringer made of 5 mm thick
sheet metal and provided with a belt 70-8 must be welded with the
bearing of the front depth rudcrwellc and led from Spt. 97 to the rear
edge of the chain box. The upper stringer, at the height of the lower
guide platform of the upper torpedo tube, shall be attached to the
bottom of the pressure body and forward to the lower guide platform of
the upper torpedo tube. The stringer should be made of 250 mm wide and 5
mm thick plates exist on its inner side with a belt of about. 70 \* 8
and with knee plates on the slats and weld edging with the outer skin.

Above the cell this is to install a stringer of 150-4 with belt 50-0 in
the waterproof back. The Stringer must be continued from Spt. 112
according to local conditions.

In front of the torpedo tube support sschott Spt. 106, continuous,
non-waterproof, 4 mm thick platforms are to be installed above and below
the torpedo tracks to guide the torpedo flaps. (Deck A, B, C and D.)
They are to be connected to the outer skin by angles of about 50 - 50 -
6, against which the platforms are bluntly welded, and with the
forestem. The mall edges of the angles of the A- and C-deck sit well
about 200 mm after each side of the torpedo centers. The lower platform
must be 5 mm thick.

In the platforms, sufficient flood openings shall be cut into the
platforms for the bleeding of the waterproof baking, which, however,
must not lie percerantly above or below the torpedo tube center lines.
The cell ceiling of dive cell 5 is to run out in front of the torpedo
tube support headscot in two long knees, into which sufficiently large
flood holes are to be cut.

e) Beams

In the rear aisle, the main carrier of the torpedo tube support
foreshore Spt. —9 to Spt. I-/3 shall be fitted with a 7 mm thick
carrier, as the upper belt of which the upper deck and as the lower belt
a flat iron 80 - 10 is to be attached. The Träg.er shall be riveted with
the upper deck at an angle of 50-50-5 and welded with the pressure body
skin and the rear end floor to which it is to be fed with a knee plate.
With the ceiling of the submersible cell 1, which pushes against the
carrier, it is to be welded and connected with you on each slat by knee
plates approaching the stiffeners 50-50 - 5 of the carrier. It must be
roped with ventilation and vent holes.

Behind the torpedo tube, the carrier is made of 5 mm thick sheet metal,
rejuvenating in height until Spt. —15 continues. Below, the bridge plate
is provided with a belt of about 70-7, at the top it is to be connected
to the upper deck at an angle 50 - 50 - 5. The base must be stiffened on
each slat.

For further support of the rear vessel, in accordance with the local
conditions, a 5 mm thick knee from Spt. —3 to Spt. 1 shall be provided
on Port and Starboard, which shall be welded approximately to 800 mm in
length with the upper edge of the pressure body. These knees are to be
stiffened on each slat with 50 - 50 - 5 and reinforced at the lower edge
with a belt 65 - 7.

The niche for the rear torpedo tube cap, such as Spt. —11 to Spt. —10,
shall be made of 5 mm sheet metal and stiffened with angles 60- 40-5.

In the aisle, a beam of 250 mm height is to be placed under the ceiling
of the submersible cell 5 on Starboard/ and Port, each about 400 now
from mid reeds; the beams should also serve as a foundation for the
anchor winch and consist of plates of 5 mm thickness. They shall be
fitted with a belt 70-8 at their free edge. The beams are well connected
to the end bottom of the pressure body and bulkhead 106.

Between the upper deck and the front sloping ceiling of the waterproof
back, a base be placed on the middle aisle, which is to be continued
after aft to Schott 102 under deck in 250 mm height and 5 mm thickness.
The ceiling of the wd. Back must be executed continuously. The
stcgplattc of the underload shall be welded at the lower free edge with
a belt 100-8, at the upper edge with a belt 70-8.

The under closure is to be connected to the bulkhead 112 with strong
angles, as the tow hook is attached to this bulkhead. It is safe to say
that the pull of the tow hook in front of it is safely picked up.

f) Cross-scott

The waterproof cross-shields 4 to 6, 92 to 97, 112 to 113 and the
oil-tight bulkheads 24 and 75 shall be made of 6 mm thick sheets and
connected to the pressure body and the outer skin by mutual welding. The
necessary stiffeners shall be made of iron and welded.

The bulkheads —10 and 102 must be made 5 mm thick.

Halfway between diving bunkers 2 and 4, a frame panel of 225 mm height
and 6 thickness with a belt of 60 - 8 must be provided and connected
well with the side stringer.

The waterproof bulkheads —9 and 106 are to be trained as torpedo tube
support bulkheads (vgL S 1 20b). The Bulkheads are to be made outside
the 10 mm thick torpedo tube support plates of 6 now sheet metal and
welded with the outer skin.

On Spt. 102 above the ceiling of dive cell 5 is a waterproof straight
bulkhead and on Spt. 112 to 113 above the top torpedo flap guide plate
form (D-Deck) a waterproof zigzag bulkhead to be incorporated. The space
separated from these bulkheads must be made as a waterproof baking tray
and accessible on Spt. 102 by a watertight manhole of 475 mm diameter
(compressed air bottle transport).

g) Other fixtures

In aisle, a chain box of 5 mm thick sheet metal with corresponding
stiffeners 50 - 6 must be installed under the torpedo tubes from Spt.
101 to Spt. 103. It is waterproof to the submersible cell 5 and made in
such a way that the rushing chain can't hook anywhere. It is to be
connected to the diving cell ceiling by a deck-crack pipe, which must be
so far that the chain does not jam anywhere during the single-hieven.
The chain box must be connected to the outer water by openings in the
outer skin, 60 mm in diameter. These also serve as mud holes. The chain
box is accessible through a manhole in the Schott 101.

To achieve a rapid flooding of the part of the submersible cell in front
of the chain box, the free flood cross-section for this room must be
measured accordingly.

11. S I Group 15 Superstructures

    a) General

The upper deck should extend over the entire length of the ship. It is
to be used without a bar bay. It is to be built so firmly that it can
withstand the sea strike safely in bad weather. The normal width of the
deck should be 2000 mm. The middle part of the upper deck should be
horizontal and about 700 mm above the top edge of the pressure body.
Towards the front, the deck is rising, in the back aisle, for example,
from the torpedo hatch, to run falling.

From Spt. 3 or Spt. 1 to Schott 102, the upper deck is to be covered
with German pine. In the area of the wooden deck, the beams are lowered
by 35 mm, so that the wooden deck is flush with the steel.

Behind Spt. 3 or Spt. 1 and in front of Schott 102, the upper deck
receives iron plating with welded warts. From the rear to Spt. — 10, the
deck is waterproof. In the rest of the rear aisle and in the aisle off
Schott 102 it is to be riveted or screwed according to the local
conditions.

For galvanizing, see (A 4i).

b) Slats, bulk, and deck beams

The slat distance of the upper deck should generally correspond to the
division of the slats of the outer ship.

The slats should generally graze from 60 x 40 x 5 mm angle. They are to
be connected to the pressure body by 4 mm thick knee plates or, where
the device of the upper deck results, by large support plates and
attached foundations.

In the area of increased stress, the slats must be strengthened
accordingly.

The knee plates should be fastened by welding. About one in four slats
is to be fitted as a frame pant of 200 mm width. Where installations do
not permit this, other reinforcements shall be provided for to achieve
the same strength. The frame panels should be 2.5 mm thick; they are to
be flanged at the free edge.

To give the upper deck a good strength, and to prevent the water from
flowing freely through the whole room under the upper deck, light
cross-shields must be installed in suitable places.

The continuous deck beams shall be made from angles 60 x 40 x 5 mm and
connected to the slats by corresponding knee plates. For the short deck
bars angles 50 - 40 - 5 are to be used. Approximately every second deck
beam shall be stiffened by galvanized pipe supports unless sufficient
reinforcement is provided by beams or other fittings.

In places of high local loads, instead of the usual deck bars, z-iron
covers 60 x 45 x 5 x 6 mm.

In the case of longer upper deck interruptions, strong beams are to be
placed as a cross-bandage and at the same time as a support for the deck
flaps in hinges.

The supports, stiffeners and bulkheads shall be set up in a removable
form to the extent necessary for the introduction of compressed air
cylinders, exhaust silencers, pipes and fittings and screwed with the
fixed parts or riveted with head rivets.

In the area of the magnetic photo compass, non-magnetizable material
(light metal) must be used in the required radius (see also S115d).

Under the upper deck, in addition to the fixed storage boxes made of
perforated sheets, storage boxes for the storage of inventory parts must
be placed (see S127b). These reservoirs are to be surrounded all around
with solid or removable built-in strong perforated sheets to

Parts well against sea strike. Also, if possible, so-called guide plates
(slap water plates) must be placed at the flood vents located near these
reservoirs or in their vicinity to drain the water flowing in during
diving from the reservoirs. For the clothing of the hatches of decline
under the upper deck, see S II 1 a.

On both sides of the torpedo hatches, vigorously trained substructures
for the torpedo takeover crane and its support are to be provided below
the upper deck (see S II 10 a).

A lockable load shall be provided at an appropriate location under the
upper deck.

The welded foundations to be placed in the front part of the upper deck
under the spill head (see S119b) must be solidly executed and surrounded
with releasable perforated sheets to avoid foreign bodies getting into
the spill's gearbox when diving. To allow occasional overtaking of the
gearbox, sea-resistant flaps of sufficient size shall be provided in the
cladding.

c) Beams.

The upper deck is to be stiffened by two beams of "]\_-iron 60 \* 45 \*
5 - 6. Insofar as this is not possible in the aisle due to the one-sided
arrangement of the torpedo hatch, other beams shall be provided
accordingly. The lower branches must be welded with the upper deck
beams.

d) Plating of the upper deck.

In the front and rear aisle, the upper deck is to receive a 4 mm thick
iron plating with welded warts. In the area of the wooden deck a deck
stringer from 150 - 2.5 must be provided and the upper deck must be
stiffened by diagonal bands of 100 \* 2.5. The large openings in the
upper deck are particularly stiffened. In the area of the magnetic photo
compass, non-magnetic material within a radius of 900 mm from the middle
compass shall be used (see S I 27 a).

The side plating must be made of 3 mm thick plates and fed to the
immersion bunkers hcrab except for a continuous flood slot of 120 mm
width. Sic \* must be riveted or welded with the slats (cf. S I 11a).
Where necessary, plating and slats must be screwed for easier
installation and overtaking of compressed air cylinders, exhaust
silencers, pipes, and fittings.

The connection of the deck stringer with the side plating is to be made
by an angle 45-30-4.

The lower edge of the side plating shall be stiffened with an internal
semi-circular iron (cf. S 11 12).

Openings in the upper deck shall be provided for the ventilation of the
upper deck. In the area of the vent valves of the diving cells and
immersion bunkers, openings are also to be placed on the side in the
upper deck cladding. Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the whole
upper deck can flood and vent quickly and completely, but nevertheless
it must be completely sea-proof.

e) Deck covering.

The upper deck is to be provided with planks made of German pine of 80
now width and 35 mm thickness, which must be laid at intervals of about
20 mm. To provide bollards and spill head as well as under the
chandeliers body woods, if available from teak wood. If planks are laid
on an iron deck, sic 100 mm wide must be taken and laid tightly. The
planks must be attached to the beams by 10 mm galvanized wooden deck
screws. Near the vent valves, slots are to be cut in greater numbers,
but no means are above the vents, avoid all openings. To arrange the
spill head on deck galvanized iron rails, which a glide of the crew
during the prevent the spill from being operated. The necessary flaps
for the torpedo introduction, the tailings, the storage spaces, and
other facilities under the upper deck shall be provided.

For stiffening of these openings, see S I 15b.

For safety of the deck flap closures against knocking off by sea, see S
I 11 g.

f) Tower conversion.

The tower is to be equipped with a conversion of light sheets, which
means the air shafts escaping from the upper deck, the high-frequency
cables (see S I 22 c), the radio tracker, the comb. Fu-MG, the round
dipole, the front very ear and in the rear part of the conversion the
substructure for the two 2 cm Flak and the cooling water high tank as
well as the eighth quadruple stand encloses.

The conversion must be made of 2.5 or 3 mm sheets and stiffened
accordingly with angles 45-30-4. The connection to the deck must be done
at an angle 75-40-5. At the Tyfon opening, the tunnum belly must be
reinforced.

In the tower conversion, light but sea-resistant flaps for storage
spaces, end organs, etc. must be ordered, as far as necessary. In
addition to the boat zu- and -abluf tkopf valves, hole-in-the-board
cross-section must be provided with a large enough cross-section. Under
the head valves of the air shafts, a light deck, on the side of the
boat's air head valve, is to be installed a impact plate, which is
intended to prevent the penetration of spray water into the air shafts
from the side and from below. In addition, partition walls must be
installed between the air valves so that leaking exhaust air cannot be
sucked back in.

The feed channels for the diesel air shaft must be raised on the Port
and Starboard sides to the top edge of the bridge buckle dress and
covered with a wire mesh.

An easily removable hood screwed onto the upper deck shall be mounted
above the magnetic photo comps, which shall be made of non-magnetizable
material at 900 mm around the middle of the compass rose. The hood must
be so firm that it cannot be pressed in by sea strike.

The cladding around the inaccessible areas between the tower sheath and
the tower conversion is to be carried out to be able to paint the
components.

A bridge protection roof made of 2.5 mm iron sheet according to normal
drawing must be attached to the front edge of the bridge deck above the
control compass.

At the aeofl of the fixed bridge buckle dress is to be ordered at
Starboard and Port each an entrance. Halfway between the upper deck and
the bridge deck, a continuous handbar shall be attached, and in the
front part of the conversion, crampons at Starboard and Port shall be
provided as an emergency entrance for the gun control.

At the rear end of the tower cladding, brackets for the rear lantern and
the ship bell should be provided (see S II 17 d and 1).

Special emphasis is placed on a good and completely sea-resistant
construction of the tower conversion.

g) Bridge.

Above the tower a fixed deck is to be installed, which serves as a
command post for the overwater ride. It is to be placed 70 mm below the
top edge of the tower lumenum, so that with 30 mm thick bridge groting,
the lusum still stands out 40 mm above top edge of the gräting.

In the rear part of the bridge, foundations for two 2 cm flak are to be
provided. The bridge deck must be extended accordingly and supported
downwards against the tower building swallow's nest. For the control
radius, see S I 19 a.

The command post is to receive a fixed, double-walled buckle dress of
about 1 535 mm height over top edge of grass on both sides. On the Port
side is before the komb. Fu-MG device is a tank shelter for the
commander to provide one for the bridge guard on the Starboard side
behind the radio operator. In these places, the dress must be continued.
The armoured compartments are made of 17 mm thick Wsh/o.Mo.armoured
plates and equipped with double doors. The schanzkleid must be trained
after the war time and provided with a nozzle of 25 mm light width to
give wind protection. At the height of the first side lantern boxes, a
110 mm wide tread plate shall be attached to the inner edge of the
buckle dress on both sides of the longitudinal side; at the same height,
the foreedge shall be high-pitched and port treadirons at the UZS-4
column.

Around the height of the bridge deck, a collar must be attached to the
tower conversion to reject waves and wind.

For a roof of bridges, see S I 15f.

If the retracted' stand-up ear protrudes over the schanzkleid, a
repellator bar must be attached over the sehrohrbock. The folding seats
to be placed in or on the buckle dress should be mounted 725 mm below
the top edge of the buckle dress.

In the front part of the bridge, a rudder stand is to be provided at
Port It is provided with a fixed pressure-resistant rudder position
pointer, a fixed pressure-resistant rotary control compass and brackets
for a removable control switch for the rudders, which relates to a
movable cable and plug inside the tower. The bridge must be extended in
such a way that there is space for two men in the front. The front
antenna should be attached to the double-walled part of the sash dress.
Furthermore, in the front part two typhones are as high as possible
above the upper deck and in the widened Starboard-Schanzkleid a bag for
the radio-peiler and on Port, in a bulge of the tower conversion, the
komb. Fu-MG and the round dipole. In addition, two 30-1 hydrogen bottles
for aphrodite shall be fitted at a suitable location. Two more bottles
should be stored under the upper deck as far as possible next to the
tower.

In the outer walls, a niche for the installation of the side lanterns is
to be installed on the Port and Starboard sides (see S II 171).

The bridge will also house the Starboard soundpipe at the front, a
column for the pressure-resistant UZS4 with a pressure-resistant
fire-off switch and mounts for the headlight and for 2 MG 81 Z, as well
as all other equipment needed for the ship's management, as it has
emerged from experience so far. For example, on the bridge, eyes must be
provided in suitable places to hook the carabiner hooks of the seat
belts. The exposed bridge deck shall be provided with a fixed railing on

Every second slat field of the ballast keel receives welded-on slat
numbers on both sides of the boat, the slat numbers are to be welded
within the keel on the pressure body in such a way that they can be read
even with jammed balfast.

In addition, on each cover plate outside at 200 mm from the top edge
abdcckplate in front, the corresponding front plate number and eights
must weld the corresponding eighth plate number, so that it can be
detected with attached cover plate, over which slat fields the cover
plate passes.

b) Ballast

The ballast required to ensure the stability and trimming of the boat
must be stored firmly in individual blocks of cast iron in the keel and
secured against unintentional movement at inclinations of the boat. The
blocks should each weigh about 25 kg. You are with. holes that allow you
to touch or hook when jammed. If necessary, fittings should be used in
the rear keel. Part of the keel ballast is supposed to consist of heavy
spar, which is firmly concreted in.

All ballast pieces must be carefully weighed before installation. The
congestion must be entered exactly in the Baiast sketch (see A 5 b).

a) Entry reserve

A reserve of 1.5 t shall be provided for in the weight calculation. It
may not be used for modifications during construction. Their focus is to
be assumed to be half the pressure body length and the half body
diameter (see A2h). The corresponding ballast must be jammed into the
keel.

   a) Very ear shafts.

For the two visual tubes, very ear shafts must be provided.

As a hiqtere sehrohr, tower ear, a stand-high ear is to be installed on
D Spt. 44. The shaft for this very ear should go with a large diameter
of lower edge pressure bodies through the submersible cell 3 and with a
smaller diameter through the central up to about the tower. Within the
dive cell 3 it is to be placed on the Port side, 210 mm from the middle
ship. It should have a clear diameter of 1 400 mm, consist of 15 mm
thick sheet metal and be pressure-resistant against 12 atm external
pressure. It must be welded with the pressure body plating as well as
with the support bulkhead D Spt. 44 and the longitudinal bulkhead of the
submersible cell 3.

Outside the submersible cell, i.e., above the cell ceiling, the shaft
should lie in the aisle and obtain a clear diameter of 980 mm at 8 mm
sheet thickness. Its upper end is to protrude into the tower until
shortly above the tower floor.

The part of the shaft located in the dive cell 3 is to be made
accessible from the control center by a pressure-resistant manhole in
the cell ceiling, which in this case is the shaft ceiling. To be able to
remove and look at the mirror box, the shaft in the control panel must
be provided with an opening of 400 mm in diameter, which must be closed
by a pressure-resistant lid with a knaggenring closure.

As a front very ear, central ear, a binocular night, and air target ear
is to be placed in front of the tower at about D Spt. 47'/g, 2420 mm in
front of the tower's very ear. It can only be operated from the control
panel.

The front ear is to be surrounded in the bridge with a light protective
tube, which is to be screwed with the inner cladding of the bridge and
provided with flood slots (see M, M II 13). l’ür the ant sehr-ear is in
the dive cell 3 a drnekfesier shaft beforez.usehen with a light
durcluncser of 380 nun nnd 8 mm wamlicke. Oer shaft is to be in the
headquarters until about. (100 mm beyond the Tauehzellendecko and end in
the Tauehzcllo3 about one hathen meter above lower edge Pressure Hull.

On the hooten, on which a normal attack ear is installed in place of the
stand-up ear, a watertight protective tube of 380 now light diameter
with drainage or lenz possibilities is to be provided within the shaft
intended for the stand-high ear around the Angrifl'ssehrohr. The annular
shaped one thus arises between the two shafts. Space should be used as a
makeshift storage space.

In the area of the operating circle of the Angrid'ssehrohres, the
l'lurboden in the tower is to be placed so far deeper in the tower in
the case of the boats without a standing ear, so far deeper than the
other l'lur-boden, that a viewing height of 1 600 is now reached. The
part of the large sehre-eye, protruding from the lowered l'lurboden,
must be burned down.

For all. The fittings and equipment of the lifting equipment must be
fitted to the appropriate foundations.

part is made of 13 mm thick sheet metal with welded
l-'lacheisetiverstärärgen hcrzustellcn and with. the insert of the
Tttrmdccke. Due to the risk of frost, the very ear-leading buck receives
drainage openings, so that the water drains. So, he'll be with. into the
tower deeke and can therefore be processed completely in the workshop.
The upper part, which is formed as a bearing for the bushing guide bush
(see M. M 11 13), is made of cast steel and with. to weld the tin
sheath. The guide buck must be carried out particularly carefully about
good stability against vibrations of the very ear. Its height should be
1 535 mm, calculated from unterkantc flange of the insert to upper edge
of very ear guide.

The front ear must be placed 280 mm in front of the tower and safely led
at the height of the tower deckin a carefully trained bearing to be
welded with the tower maider.

A bracket for a signal headlamp must be provided on the very ear buck.

Compass- snung.

The boat is to be equipped with an e-passport system, with five daughter
apparatuses and with a magnetic photo compass with optical transmission
to the control center.

The mother compass is to be placed in the headquarters behind the large
very ear shaft. Five daughters are to be operated by him, namely one
control gate at each rudder for the rudder in the control room, in the
tower and on the bridge, as well as a radio-bearing daughter in the
radio room and a wall daughter, in the listening room.

The necessary brackets must be provided for the compate daughters. For
this purpose, a compass bracket must be arranged at the emergency rudder
stand in the rear compartment, into which the steering daughter fits
from the rudder stand of the rudder from the control panel.

The compass in the control panel must be provided with a 3 m long cable
so that it can be used alternately for the emergency control stand or
for the card table.

The daughter compass on the bridge must be pressure-resistant and
installed in a pressure-tight manner. The daughter's compass at the

S II Locksmith's Workshop

4. S II Group 1 closures for printed body, bulkhead, decks, and outer
   skin.

   a) Hatch covers

All hatches should have curved, outward-facing covers. The covers are to
be made of cast steel (see A3b), except for the tower hatch cover, which
is to be cast from the same material as the tower ceiling (see S I 18c).
The thickness of the cover should generally be 17 mm, the inner radius
of curvature about 900 mm for normal hatches and about 850 mm for
torpedo hatches. The top of the tower hatch is 30 mm thick and has an
inner curvature radius of 555 mm. Each lid should be provided with a
central lock that presses the lid firmly against the hatch coaming by
means of lugs. To operate the lock, a handwheel must be placed inside
and outside, on which the sense of movement for "open and close" is to
be indicated. A pendulum trap must be installed to prevent unintentional
actuation of the lock in the open position. Each cover must be equipped
with a secure snap lock that prevents the cover from jumping back after
it has been slammed, and with a locking device that holds the snap lock
in the tensioned state.

In addition, detachable hatch safety devices are to be provided on each
hatch cover, which can be used if attacks with depth charges are to be
feared. In the case of the tower hatch cover, which is to be provided
with a worm drive, there is no need to attach these hatch locks. These
fuses are also unnecessary on the central hatch cover.

So that each individual lid can be opened easily, its weight must be
balanced by springs, which must be dimensioned accordingly. The tower
hatch cover is to be equipped with 2 springs. It must be considered that
the flaps of the upper deck hinged to the companionway and torpedo
hatches must also be opened at the same time.

The weights of similar covers must match the weights given on the
drawings within the tolerance so that the hatch springs can be easily
replaced. The springs of the central hatch cover are to be dimensioned
so that they can be used as reserve springs for the tower hatch cover.
About the diameter of the steer yourself S I 4 f.

The central locks of all hatches should be able to be opened not only
from the inside, but also from the outside, so that a diver can get into
the interior of the boat through each hatch if the hatch protection
against depth charges has not been attached inside the boat.

A locking device for the open cover must be attached to all hatches,
except for the tower hatch. The tension of the relief springs for the
tower hatch and the position of the stopper for the open position are to
be coordinated so that the tower hatch is sufficiently fixed in the open
position without a locking device. The storage and guidance of the tower
hatch cover is particularly strong. Ahe stoppers are to be attached in
such a way that the hatch covers are not stressed on one side when
striking against them. The central hatch should be able to be slammed
quickly from below through the depth control ladder. The top of the
tower hatch must be provided with 1 handle so that it can be closed
quickly if a lake suddenly comes over. The handle must be clear of the
stop to avoid hand injuries when opening the cover.

The lids of the tower hatch and the companionway hatch are to have a
sampling valve.

The sealing of all hatch covers should be done by guinmi profiles, which
are attached to the covers and rest on metal rails to be let into the
coamings of the hatches. The Guinmi profiles are to be fitted and glued
into the dovetail-shaped grooves with great care. Oil-resistant Buna
according to workshop standard sheet RM9602 must be used for torpedo
hatches, diesel air head and foot valves, room air head and foot valves,
quick vents for diving times, emergency shut-off flaps for diving cells
and diving bunkers (see A 3 b). The standardization of the Guinmi
profiles is to be used as a basis for the dimensions of the rubber
profiles.

The flaps to be installed over the companionway hatches and torpedo
hatches on the upper deck should be connected to the hatch covers in
such a way that they open and close together with them and are held in
their closed position by the hatch covers. They are to be connected to
the hatch covers by bolts that can be easily released from the upper
deck, so that the diver can loosen these connections to gain access to
the locks of the hatch covers.

Around the companionway hatches and torpedo hatches, shafts are to be
built from light metal sheets to protect them from impact by the sea and
are to be provided with flood and drainage openings. The flaps of these
flood openings are closed when the hatch cover is open and opened when
the hatch cover is closed.

b) Bulkhead doors

The pressure-resistant bulkheads D Spt. 39 and 50 '/ ^ have door
openings with a clear diameter of 800 mm, which are closed by arched,
pressure-resistant doors. The doors are 14 mm thick and made of cast
steel with a radius of curvature of 900 mm and are to be provided with
rubber seals that seal the base angle rings made of cast steel, which
are connected to the bulkheads by double riveting (see page 17b).

The door is to be pressed onto the sealing surface by a collar ring
lock, which must be operable from both sides of the bulkhead by means of
a toothed segment with a hand lever. The collar rings are to be made
from Stg 45.81 Bk or welded together from fluoro iron. Sufficient
lubrication must be ensured so that rusting on is absolutely avoided.
The lock ring hinge must be blocked to prevent it from shifting when the
door is open. It must be possible to fix the door when it is open.

The watertight bulkheads D Spt.l6 '/ g, 29 and 03 should have door
openings with a clear width of 1450 \* 550 mm. The doors must be
provided with sash locks on the long and short sides. The sash locks on
the long sides are to be connected to each other by rods so that they
can be closed with two handles from each bulkhead side. A locking
mechanism must be provided to prevent the sash turns unintentionally
when the door is open. A spring latch is to be arranged for normal use.

The light, splash-proof doors of the toilet and provisions rooms are
designed as hinged doors for door openings of 1450-450 mm clear width.
They are to be equipped with rubber seals and chamber door locks with
handles.

The toilet room doors have square keys on the outside.

The radio and UT room and the listening room will have double-leaf
wooden doors. The door openings 1450 - 510 now have a clear width. The
doors are to be provided with felt seals. You get security locks and
door handles.

The fittings for the doors are to be sunk so that the doors can be
opened by 180.

A small flap that opens from the outside and inside and flaps downwards
and outwards is to be arranged in each door about 1.2 m above the
corridor to pass messages. When defining the doors, the transport of the
battery and the spatial conditions must be considered.

The doors for the battery self-switching rooms are to be designed with
two leaves according to local conditions. They must be as airtight as
possible and are therefore provided with additional sash turnbuckles
and, if necessary, seals made of felt strips.

c) Pressure-resistant manhole lids.

Manhole covers with a clear width of 400 - 300 mm are to be provided for
the control cells, control bunkers and subsurface cells. You should get
enforced coaming rings made of mild steel or cast steel, which are to be
welded to the plating of the cells, etc. The 15 mm thick manhole covers
are to be sealed with head screws and washers with packing; Light metal
sheets are to be provided over the manholes to cover the head screws.

The trim and torpedo cells, the diving cell 3 and the periscope shaft
are to receive manhole covers made of Stg 45.81 BK with a clip lock. The
clear opening should be 300 - 400 mm. The cover of the immersion cell 3
is also 6 pcs. To provide hinged screws. New design is in progress.

The coaming rings for the manhole covers must be welded in before the
cell covers are welded on.

d) Light manhole ceiling.

The bunkers, engine oil tanks and drinking water cells, the submersible
cells and bunkers, the waterproof rear, the waterproof back, the chain
box and rooms separated for other purposes are accessible by a
sufficient amount of manholes. The manholes should be 300 - 400 mm light
width and simple, 5 to 8 mm thick screwed lid with appropriate packing.

For rinsing the cells lying in the outer nave, the flooded rooms, and
the chain box during the docking period, as well as for the maintenance
of inaccessible areas of the outer vessel, screwed mud and hand holes
must be provided where necessary. The mud holes are to be placed as deep
as any.

The screwing of the manhole and hand hole lids should generally be done
by iron pin screws and nuts, which are to be well set with lead white.

e) Entrance hatches in the inner deck.

The 5 mm thick siphone lids to the ammunition chamber, the room for
T-devices and the battery compartments are to be arranged flush with the
deck. The clear width of the entrance openings should generally be 500
\* 500 mm. The hatch in the room for T-devices is given 500-400 light
width (see S19d).

The hatch covers are to be sealed on all sides by front ruporter
ruporter seal. They are given handles sunk in shells and are to be
covered with linoleum in the same way as the inner deck.

The hatch cover for the ammunition chamber must be locked and provided
with an easily stashed grass. To be able to use the T-device room as a
supply load, a lockable grass lid must also be supplied. For each
battery compartment, a wooden inlay with air holes must be made and
holdered under the battery cover.

f) Battery cover plates.

The battery compartments must be covered with airtight screwed 5 mm
thick plates fitted with ruporter seals to allow easy expansion of the
cells (see S19b). All panels of the battery compartment ceilings shall
be provided with a linoleum coating outside the lockers, which shall be
glued and secured by galvanized iron rails at the edges.

g) Flaps in the upper deck.

Special care must be taken to secure all flaps in the upper deck.

The upper deck flaps, insofar as they are in the iron-plated upper deck
part, shall be made of sheets of the thickness of the iron plating and
shall be provided above, like the iron-plated parts of the upper deck,
with welding cues against slipping. All flaps should be flush with the
deck. The edge of the flaps must be stiffened by welded flat irons.
Larger flaps are particularly good to stiffen against sea strikes.

Flaps located in the wood-planked upper deck part are generally to be
made of angular frame 30-30-4 mm or 30-45-4 mm and 2.5 mm belt plates,
which are to be reinforced with larger flaps by diagonal bands, angular
stiffeners or so. The angular frames shall be filled with a surface of
pine wood, according to the upper deck plating. The planks are to be
arranged longitudinal vessels (see S115e).

The wood in the flaps should lie flush with that of the upper deck.

The flaps are generally to be placed in such a way that they open after
the bow.

All flaps, especially the large ones, must be provided in sufficient
numbers with strong hinges and with powerful! safe and tightly closing
rear-turned screws, which are to be operated with a key, so that the
flaps do not rattle during the journey and are necessarily secured
against being knocked out by sea strike.

Flaps, which must also be opened by the diver, must be equipped with
so-called divers. These diver's foretours shall be carried out for right
and left in such a way that they cannot be gradually loosened by sea
strikes; a right-wing and a left-wing version must therefore be chosen
for them.

On the fore and back, one flap is to be provided with divers' forehand.
Under these flaps, one key for the operation of the other upper deck
flaps to be closed with rear-screw screws shall be holder.

The flaps for the diver must be so large that the diver can approach the
fittings without any difficulties and hit hoses well.

The flaps above the large upper deck openings (the torpedo hatches,
etc.) must be subdivided so that they can be easily handled. They are
particularly easy to stiffen and fasten so that they cannot strike in
heavy seas. Where necessary, beams must be pulled over the large flaps.

The flaps over the boarding and torpedo hatches shall be connected to
the lids of the hatches themselves; they should be opened and closed
with them (see SU la).

The flaps of the standby ammunition boxes must be provided with divers'
forepieces. The flaps must be closed by padlocks. In the area of the
magnetic photo compass, the frames of the kiappene and the fittings are
made of non-magnetizable material (see S115f).

Very small flaps are made of galvanized caterpillar sheet. All flaps are
provided with handles in shells, which get a small drainage hole.

Flaps via vent valves do not receive slots. Shells that receive a small
drainage hole are to be provided under handle holes.

Flaps over thaw loads must be provided with a quarter-round cutout in
the corner, which indicates the corresponding bollard, so that the rope
can run through it.

For larger parts, such as exhaust valves and similar devices, must be
fitted to bolted, framed upper deck panels for overhaul work, if these
areas are not accessible by flaps. For's exhaust-air-exhaust distributor
is to install a flap.

All flaps, hinges, pre-resider, label marks and the like must be placed
in the wooden deck to avoid all protruding edges and corners as far as
possible.

5. S II Group 2 railings.

A detached railing on both sides of the upper deck is not provided for
the duration of the war. However, the traces for the supports must
continue to be installed so that the supports can be installed during
the shipyard mooring period, during docking. All shipyards must store
several sets of supports with railing strains. The need for supports
with passages must be requested from the Nachbaubi.ro the Germaniawerft
from the existing stocks.

On the side of the quadruple stand, two railing scoundues are placed on
your upper deck, which relate to removable passages.

The bridge deck and the quadruple platform must be provided with a fixed
railing. In the railing on the bridge, two passages are to be placed on
both sides of the board, two of them on the rear platform and two on the
upper deck. In addition, a passage to the upper deck shall be provided
for from the quadruple flatforin on both sides of the board.

6. S II Group 3 ladders and crampons.

An iron ladder should be provided under the Decline Hatch, the Central
Hatch, the Tower Hatch, and the Front Torpedo Hatch. The ladders must be
carried out in such a way that they are easily walkable and easily
removable, nor must they hinder the passage in the boat. The tower
ladders and the central ladders must curse together and get to slip
downside bars, which are to be pulled down briefly over the hallway.
They must be provided with fuses against the outfall in the event of a
sea.

Above the hatches, in the upper deck, if necessary, are to install
crampons or short ladders.

Under the rear torpedo hatch, steps are to be provided at Schott D
Spt.lö'/.

To climb the bridge from the upper deck, crampons are to be advanced at
the tower conversion, on the Starboard and Port sides at the rear and at
the front tower conversion for one ascent each. When arranging the
ladders and crampons to the bridge, it is particularly important to note
that the way out of the control center through the tower to the bridge
and from then on dock must also be covered with a bad weather suit. In
addition, crampons shall be provided from the quadruple platform to the
bridge on Starboard and Port- Seitc.

Convenience must be considered when measuring the height of the rungs
and width of the ladders, etc. The distances of the steps shall be the
same distance and the distance of the steps from the wall in the case of
crampons shall be so great that the louß can be placed sufficiently deep
on the steps. The crampons attached to the front edge of the tower
conversion can have an abnormally wide distance.

In addition, crampons, kicks, and handles must be placed in the
submersibles, bunkers and other rooms as required.

For the seafall recp to be supplied, traces in the front upper deck on
Port and Starboard must be provided. (See Zimmcrinanndevice.)

KM 61 and A 4i).

Material: Pipes: Flow iron galvanized inside and outside. Cables that
pass-through fuel oil bunkers, engine oil tanks and battery compartments
are only to be galvanized inside. Hot seawater pipes: CCuF25 (galvanized
during the war, however). Particularly thick-walled pipes shall be used
for the pipes which are exposed to seawater outside and inside, as well
as for the pipe pieces that are directly attached to the suction and
pressure nozzles of the pumps.

Fittings: Larger valves or sliders are made of cast steel or steel
welded and galvanized. Smaller fittings are made of galvanized steel
casting, see A3b. For the valve seats, carrying welding (electrical arc
welding or gas melt welding) of suitable composition shall be used.
Interior parts, if necessary, red casting.

The application welding must not detach from the valve seat under
warranty, even under the sharpest loads.

Small valves and through valves can be made of bronze, but the use of
fuel must be largely avoided.

The first on-board wall valves of all cables should in principle be
designed as Kingston valves (closing with your water pressure) (see
A4c). When assembling and installing the fittings, care must be taken to
ensure that the display devices do not block the fittings until sic is
completely closed or opened.

Test pressure: Suction lines of the main and auxiliary ducts as well as
lime milk pipes must generally be tested with 3 atm sample pressure.
Annaturen and pipes that can receive high pressures during operation,
e.g., fittings in the main duct line, which are exposed to high
pressures when the control cells are flooded or when expressing with
compressed air at depth, are to be designed for an operating pressure of
25 atm, as well as all first and second on-board closures.

Test pressures for these fittings and cables see A 4e.

Pipelines passing through the pressure body, through cells, bunkers or
tanks should be laid and welded in before the pressure test of the rooms
concerned. Likewise, all reinforcement flanges must be welded into the
walls of the rooms to be tested before the pressure test. In the case of
screw flanges, the subsequent components must be mounted. In the absence
of the connecting parts, reinforcement flanges must be sealed before the
pressure test by blind flanges. Before the first commissioning and after
repairs of the pipes odct fittings, the suctions for the detection of
their airtightness must also be pressed with compressed air and checked
by brushing with soapy water.

Drainage screws for complete drainage of the pipelines shall be
provided.

All pipelines must be laid as straight and evenly as possible to avoid
unnecessary resistance and air borne. Where necessary, accessible
protective screens must be ordered.

Care must be taken to ensure that, in normal circuits (e.g., suction
with Hill'slenz pump from auxiliary duct line or sucking with main loop
pump from main loop line) cross-sectional changes during the lines are
avoided as far as possible in all cases.

All shut-off organs, junctions, manifolds, etc. should be properly
formed to reduce the flow resistance. Branches should be connected at
angles. <

When setting up the pumps and laying the pipeline, the greatest
attention must be paid to noise attenuation during operation. All
operating noise must be largely attenuated by intermediate pieces of
vibrating metal or in any other appropriate manner.

Overflow or vent lines should end visibly over corridors. They must be
led over catch hoppers after the bilge. If necessary, several pipelines
can be guided via a common funnel.

a) Pumps.

An electrically driven self-priming centrifugal pump is to be installed
in the central center (see M, M II 6).

An electrically driven trim pump, which is also intended to serve as an
auxiliary pump, is also to be placed in the control panel (see M, M 11
7).

The main bilge pump as well as the auxiliary and trim pump must be
provided with a shut-off valve at the suction and pressure side.

A double-acting hand piston pump type "Frankonia Nr. 5v" from Klein,
Schanzlin & Becker, Frankenthal is to be supplied as a hand-held pump.
This pump is supposed to provide about 164 1 at 66 double strokes per
minute. In the cast-iron pump housing, the suction and pressure valves
trained as cone valves are to be placed. A normal hose coupling (storz
coupling) N W 52 according to DIN FEN must be installed on the suction
and pressure side of the pump. However, the connection hoses (pressure
and suction hoses) also supply with delivery receive only 45 mm light
width. The coupling halves NW 52, which are seated on the hoses, are
therefore to be sonicated with (abnormal) hose sleeves for connection to
45 hoses.

The handbil pump is fixed in a suitable place, easy to reach and easy to
stow. The pump receives a footboard so that it can be placed at any
point. In the storage position' the footboard serves as a sination board
in the E machine room.

In the kitchen a hand-wing pump is to be provided as a drinking water
pump, in the control center also a hand-wing pump is to be placed in the
pipe between drinking water generator and drinking water cell 1. In the
suction nozzle of the drinking water hand pump in the kitchen, a
ball-beating valve is to be installed, which prevents an idle of the
pump housing after pumping.

In the bow room, a hand-held pump for washing water is to be installed
from the torpedo cells and in the front toilet dream another hand-held
pump for conveying from the washing cell in the front accumulator space.
(c) flood and bilge devices of the control, undershoot and torpcdo
cells.

The control cclals and bunkers are to be flooded by a bottom valve NW
140, which is to be placed in the control center. The Ted of the control
cells above the waterline must be replenished with the main feed pump. A
valve box NW 140 with a connection to the distribution valve box of the
control cells and to the suction line of the main loop pump shall be
connected to the bottom valve. The flood lines of the four regei cells
or bunkers receive NW 100. The bottom valve must be operated at any
water depth of up to 120 m. For this purpose, pressure compensation can
be prepared via the vent valve in the fine-tuning line of the control
cells. The bottom valve is given a compressed air connection for blowing
through.

A Seevent.il NW 00 for the fine flooding of the control cells and
bunkers must be installed in the pressure body skin behind the tower. To
protect against contamination, a top-tight hood perforated on the sides
must be put on at the outlet. A quantity counter shall be connected to
the nw 60 fine flood line, which shall be set up for both flow
directions (i.e., for floods and lenzen). The fine lululine receives a
double termination. The first end should close with the external
pressure, the second against the external pressure. A vent valve NW 20
must be connected to the fine flood line so that pressure compensation
can be prepared in the controller, flood, and bilge valves for easier
opening of these valves. The control cclals and lunkers must be equipped
with water levels, which are to be placed in the control center.

Water level glasses made of plexiglass of standardized design must be
provided for all control cells and bunkers. Valves must be installed as
barriers.

The lenzing of the control cells and bunkers should be carried out by
the main bilge pump. The distribution box with four valves NW 100 for
the control cells is to be used for both lenzen and flooding the control
cells. All four valves therefore receive fixed cones. The connecting
line from the distribution box to the bottom valve is NW 140, the
suction connection of the main bilge pump NW HO. Facilities which also
allow a lenzen with the trim pump shall be provided. The bilge water
from the control cells or bunkers must flow through a sieve pot before
entering the main or auxiliary pump.

The control cells and bunkers are to receive individually lockable vent
lines NW 32, which go over a funnel line to the central bilge. The vent
pipes must be introduced so deep into the control cells that an air
cushion of 6°/o of the contents remains. The vent lines of the control
cells and bunkers should only be simple (2nd), the undershoot cells
double (1st and 2nd) on-board deals. The shut-off valves of the
ventilation lines of the control bunkers shall be sealed in a closed
position when these cells are driven as bunkers. A test valve must be
provided for the removal of oil on each vent line for the control
bunkers (see M, MI 5). The ends of the control cell vent lines must be
led to noise attenuation\* during venting in a common silencer.

The flood and bilge distributors of the control cells shall be connected
by a line NW 70 to the exhaust pipe of the bilge pumps, so that the
control cells can be expressed according to submersible cell 3 or
outward board.

All four control cells or bunkers are to be given compressed air
connections for blowing out. The pressure differential meters, and
safety valves required for this purpose must be provided (see M, MII4).,

All pipes and fittings that can get pressure when blowing out the
control cells must be formed against an operating pressure of 25 atm
pressure resistant.

If possible, the undershoot cells receive a special flood valve of 220
mm light diameter and a lockable vent line NW 60, which can be operated
from the control panel. Both vents are to be combined to a common vent
valve NW 80, which is located on the Port side, which is to drain into
the central unit via a silencer. The vent lines are to be provided nut
(torii.use. hdämpforn and individually to guide via funnels to the bush.

The (iostiinge for the drive of the fillvalves is votn)) jerk body made

detectable check-back cones The bilge valves , if they are not housed in
the control center itself, should be operated from both sides of the
adjacent waterproof bulkhead.

In the battery compartments and in the diesel engine compartment, swamps
must be welded into the pressure body skin under the biling points to
ensure the most complete lenzen of the biles; in the control center is a
swamp in the diving cell ceiling and in the front one in the bunker
ceiling.

The main loop line should be able to be flooded by the bottom valve or
the fine flood line in the control panel. In the rear compartment and in
the control panel, ventilation must therefore be provided at suitable,
high-altitude locations, and the barriers of the main duct strands
leading forwards and backwards must be equipped with ORZ valves, so that
the flooding of the main duct line into the end rooms is possible. This
further ensures that in the event of leaks occurring at any point, the
strand in question can be blocked off.

Above the square of the main duct valves for the accumulating valves, a
cap protected by plombing against removal shall be provided, which makes
it impossible to place the hand crank or other control panel on the
spindle of the accumulat valves. The caps must bear the label: "Safety
only in case of danger. The hand crank for each bilge valve thus secured
must be stored separately near the valve.

Immediately at the main and auxiliary pump, a barrier must be put sö at
both the suction and the pressure side, so that in case of accident a
repair (removal) of a pump without disturbing the entire bilge and trim
operation with the still undamaged pump is guaranteed.

In addition, in the diesel engine room at the Schott is 16*/. behind the
branch of the rear bilge point, place a shut-off valve NW 110 in the
bilge line to the E engine room.

The screen pots (filters) shall be designed in such a way that no
foreign objects can fall into the suction lines of the main and
auxiliary auxiliary pumps when replacing contaminated filter inserts.
The filter inserts must be given cup shape; the bilge water to be
filtered should flow through the filter cup from the inside out, foreign
bodies and dirt should remain in the filter cup. The sieve floor should
not be given holes. The sieve pots on the pumps must be formed to be
pressure resistant. To ensure a quick replacement of the filter inserts
in case of contamination, a spare insert must be supplied for each sieve
pot. In addition to the two normal sieve inserts, two sieve inserts with
a particularly fine mesh size are to be supplied, which are to be driven
only during the testing period and are returned to the shipyard. The
sieve pots in the main loop line are to be given knaggenring closure.

b) Auxiliary line.

Auxiliary lines shall be provided for the other suction points. The
performance of the trim pump should be decisive for the dimensions of
the pipes for the larger auxiliary points. For the power of the trim
pump, see M, M II 7. To connect to the auxiliary line: -

In the rear compartment: The torpedo cell 1 with pipeline NW 70.

In the rear battery compartment: The dirty water cell 1 with NW 40.

In the head office: The shafts for the Sta-Sehrohr and for the
luftzielsehrohr as well as the front central bilge with NW 40 each.

In the front battery compartment: The ammunition chamber with NW 70, the
room for T-devices and the Schmufzwasserzelle 2 with NW 50 each

In the bow room: Torpedo cells 2 and 3 with NW 70 each.

A connecting line of the main loop line to the auxiliary cable shall be
laid in such a way that each pump can take over all the tasks of the
foldedpump in the event of failure of the other pump. ­lenen Pumpe

With the auxiliary encoder pump, it must be possible to loop the control
cells from the biles of the rear compartment and the diesel engine
compartment.

In the headquarters. provide a suction hose connection NW 40 with normal
coupling NW 52 so that the bilge water passes through the sieve pot.

In addition, a hose connection for the accumulates should be provided.
The bearing tubes of the battery compartments are provided with hose
couplings, which can be mounted or removed at will on the bearing tubes.
The main loop valves to the accumulates, since the lenzen is normally
carried out by the bearing tubes, are to be provided with fuses, which
are only removed in the event of danger (see SH6d).

c) Exhaust pipe.

The exhaust pipes of the main bilge pump NW 100 and the trimming pump c
NW 80 are to be led to außcnbord via a common lactation valve NW 100. In
addition, it should be possible to pass the pouring water of the main
lallea and trim pump via a pipe NW 80 to the inner submersible cell 3.
The arrangement of the exhaust lines should be carried out in such a way
that both pumps can also work at the same time (exhaust for main branch
pump to the outside, casting of the auxiliary pump according to
submersible cell 3.) Furthermore, the pressure line of the trim pump
should receive a hose connection for normal screw ingestion NW 52 with
shut-off organ NW 40.

d) drainage and bearing pipes.

The fiur floor above the rear battery compartment is to be drained by
the lateral trenches, which can be shut off after the bilge of the
diesel engine compartment. Double closures should be provided for the
drainage. The kitchen gets a special drainage over the rear part of
these ditches. The sewage from the kitchen must be discharged into the
dirty water cell 1, the wastewater from the front toilet dream and votp
sink in the officer's room as well as the overflow pipe of the drinking
water cell 3 into the dirty water cell 2. The rear battery self-switch
room and the rear toilet dream drain after digging on Starboard, the
front self-switch room after the ammunition chamber. The tower is
drained by two separate pipes N W 00, which can be locked in the central
by taps, after the central bilge. Blowing through these lines by means
of compressed air can be done with the existing tool hose.

Hose connections for blowing through these lines by means of compressed
air shall be provided. All pipes connected to the dirty water cells must
be closed against the rooms by odor closures. The dirty water cells
themselves are to be ventilated into the room exhaust air pipe via a
fermentation closure. The fermentation seal must have a lockable filling
opening and an overflow opening; it must be designed in such a way that
the water filling cannot be injected with compressed air even when the
individual pipes are blown through or when the dirty water cell is fully
inflated.

To avoid blockages of the drainpipes in the kitchen and in the toilet
rooms, removable application screens shall be provided for dewatering in
the floor.

All inner cells, except for the inner submersible cell 3, should receive
bearing devices which are easily accessible and must lie in such a way
that the bearings become precise, and the non-peilbable residual water
quantity remains as low as possible. The bearing pipe of the dirty water
cells receives a normal hose coupling NW52 for connection to the
hand-held pump.

The bearing tubes of the torpcdo cells are given an intermediate piece
for setting up the drinking water-washing ctrichier (see S D 6k) for the
onboard gabc of washing water.

water levels of the rogel cells and bunkers must be carried out in a
pressure test.

As a bearing device, a test tube must be installed in the undershoot
ducts, which is now to be lowered below the top edge cell or 1 070 by
1360 and which is to flow into a funnel in the control panel. See a. 8
II 6c.

For bunker-bearing equipment, see M, Ml 5.

e) Trim line.

The trimming slackens in the bow and hecktorpcdorauin are to be
connected by a special line NW 80, into which a trim switch with
connection to the pressure and suction control NW 80 of the trim pump is
to be switched on.

The trim switch shall be equipped with a clearly visible display device
and set up in such a way that the pressure line of the trim pump can
only be connected to one trim cell, while the suction line is connected
to the other. A trim valve must be incorporated into the trim line,
which prevents the trimming water from overshooting from one cell to the
other in case of load of the boat. In the control panel, a quantity
meter for 1 000 litres, indicating both flow direction, shall be
installed at an appropriate location, at which the trimmed water
quantity can be read. When trimming forward, the pointer should move to
the right. The front trim cell is to be equipped with a bearing tube,
the rear one with a water level.

The flooding and lenz of the trimmings should be carried out with the
help of the auxiliary lcnz and trim pump.

Bleeds trimming with compressed air M, M II 4. -

f) Drinking water pipe.

A special drinking water line N W 25, which is to be used for filling
and lenzing the drinking water cells in the rear battery room, in the
central and in the front living room, is to be installed.

In the kitchen, a hand pump must be switched on in the pipe. In
addition, a normal hose fitting NW 52 for connecting the drinking water
line to the auxiliary and trim pumps via hose connections is to be
ordered in the line.

Above the kitchen, a transfer line with an abnormal screwing is to be
arranged with a pressure body entry, on which an overflow funnel is to
be attached, which receives the normal takeover coupling of the navy for
drinking water on the side. The drinking water fitting is to be housed
in the upper deck. The funnel must be inside the boat. There must also
be a gooseneck with the counter-slinging of the takeover line on board,
so that it is possible to give washing water to the upper deck.

The drinking water pipes are to be manufactured from galvanized steel
pipe inside and outside.

An active carbon filter shall be switched on in the drinking water pipe
in such a way that the drinking water can be removed both by the filter
and bypassing it. The drinking water facility must allow the following
circuits to be carried out:

Transfer of drinking water with natural gradient (without pump) yon
outside into all drinking water cells,

Transfer of drinking water with the help of the drinking water hand pump
from outside into all drinking water cells,

Pumping with the drinking water hand pump from drinking water cell 1 to
the front drinking water cells or vice versa,

From the drinking water hand pump from each cell,

From the auxiliary pumpc in the control center via hoses and hose
connections from each cell.

The water obtained by the fresh water generator and collected in an
intermediate tank shall be fed via a hand pump via a curing filter of
the drinking water cell 1 via a special pipe.

About fresh water producers M, M II 9.

g) Washing water pipe.

Lines NW 20 for cold and warm seawater must be connected to the cooling
water pressure pipe or the cooling water high-temperature holding and to
guide it to the küzhe. In the case of the conduction by the pressure
body, on-board valves shall be placed.

The sinks in the toilet dreams should each receive a connection NW 20 to
the washing water pipe. The sink in the front toilet room also has a
hot-sec water connection.

The upper deck shower must be connected to the cover washing, so that a
shower with cold sea water is possible. A shower tube to be hung over
the rear antenna must be supplied.

Torpedo cells 1 and 2 shall be cinto-directed to absorb washing water.
The cells must be filled through the bearing tubes. To remove washing
water from Torpedozelle 1, the cell is slightly pressured, and the water
is tapped by a riser ear with tap. From Torpedozelle 2 the water is
taken by means of a wing pump permanently installed in the bow room. By
changing a three-way valve in the front toilet room, the same pump can
also be removed from the washing water cell.

The wash basin in the front toilet dream can receive washing water via a
special washing water hand pump (wing pump) from the washing water cell
in the front battery compartment or from the torpedo cell 2, which is
permanently installed in the toilet room. The washbasin in the rear
ktoset room is to be supplied with washing water via a small, highly
attached washing water tank, which can be filled by the drinking water
hand pump.

Various side solutions.

In the upper deck, a deck washing line is to be laid, which is to
receive a normal hose coupling NW 52 in the middle of the upper deck for
connecting the deckwash schläuchc (45 now light width). It can be shut
off on the pressure body to the pressure line of the trim pump.

To be able to sprinkle and rinse the battery compartment with lime milk
and water, within the accumulator rooms along the propellant oil bunker
wall, on top of Port and Starboard a perforated pipeline NW 40 must be
laid, whose normal hose coupling NW 52 is easily accessible near the
decline hatch or front torpedo hatch. The Kaikmilchspidung should be
carried out with natural gradient from a bucket, which can be hung on
top of the slats. The flushing can also be done directly with handlenx
pump via a hose line.

The handbilge pumps shall be used for the lenzing of the rear bilges (E
machine room and diesel room bilges) During the dive, the bilge water
should be able to be pressed into the control cells with this pump.

The ammunition chamber must be given a gooseneck for ventilation.

#. S II Group 7 Facilities for rudder, rudder.

   a) General.

For rudders and their arrangement, see S I 13.

The rudder shafts of the rudders and the shafts of the deep rudders are
given rudder levers to which the movement of the push rods of the rudder
machines is transmitted by steering rods.

The push rod for the rear deep rudders goes through an anguß in) rear
end floor and that of the front depth rudder through a particularly
hcrset steel casting piece. Both passage points are provided with
plug-in sockets that can be retracted from the inside. In the case of
deep rudder drives, straight guides are to be placed outside the
pressure body. From the straight guide, a push rod should go directly to
the rudder lever at the front deep rudder, while in the drive for the
rear depth rudder a intermediate with two levers, which are offset to
each other, is to be switched.

The pressure body feedthroughs for the rudder pressure rods shall be
provided with bushings made of S Rg 5.

The drive of the rudders is carried out by means of a vertical
intermediate shaft, which occurs between D Spt. l and 2 through the
pressure body. The bearing for this shaft is arranged on the pressure
body and receives an internally rotating stuffing box. On the
intermediate shaft sits at the top (in the upper deck) a double lever,
from which two long push rods lead to the Seitcnrudcrhcbcln pointing to
the middle ship. Over the rudder shafts or rudder levers, the plain
bearings and above the vertical pressure body feed shaft, flaps are to
be placed in the upper deck to be able to maintain the drive parts and
to be able to mount or remove them (see SH lg).

The lubrication must be placed particularly carefully. Central
lubrication must be provided for the front and rear vessel, which is
operated from the inside of the boat (see A4g).

b) Rudder stalls.

For the rudders, a rudder stand for electric rudder switches in the
central and in the tower is to be provided. On the bridge should
brackets)! for a rudder switch, the other way. a bracket on the mother's
compass.

In addition to these rudder stands, an emergency rudder stand for manual
drive in the rear compartment must be set up for the rudders and
provided with a mechanical rudder pointer.

The Seitcnrudcrnotstcuerstand with bevel gear slower is to be set to
vibrating metal. A swinging metall coupling must be built between the
emergency steering position and The Köllmann-Gctriebe. The eye on the
pressure body to which the strut is attached, which holds the
Scitenruder emergency control position in operating position, must also
be placed on vibrating metal.

For the deep rudders, the rudder stands in the central on the Starboard
side are next to each other. The axles for the handwheels are
rpicrschifls to tag.

The handwheels of the deep rudder stands must be set up from the deep
ruder cable. In the case of shadowing the rudder on manual drive, the
electric rudder system must be made strondos by blocking it. The
kcgelradgehäusc, the bearings of the rudder lines.n and the rudder
stands shall be insulated with vibrating metal against the pressure
body.

The movements of the deep rudders are to be transferred by telekin
conductor cn to mechanical rudder hands in the control center and the
Turan, so that the respective rudder steps are displayed at any time in
the central and in the command tower (even in the event of failure of
the electric rudder hands). The telekin conductors shall be connected to
the deep rudder drives in suitable places in the end rooms.

The telekin conduction cn s are to be led from the acceptance points
water- and pressure-resistant, possible in a straight line with the
avoidance of sharp curvatures to the central and the tower. Receiver
cans must be connected in the control panel and in the tower. The
receiver doses should receive scales and hands. The scales in the lurm
should have bright writing on black ground. The writing and teihing of
the devices in the command tower must be limped out with radioactive
luminous paint. The scales of the etna-piängerdoscn in the headquarters
are given black writing on a base of phosphorescent luminous paint.

To bring the boat to depth), both handwheels are moved against the clock
hand during manual operation; the front deep rudder blowers then point
downwards with their foresides, the rear upwards.

At the rudder spindles of the front and rear depth rudders as well as on
the side rudcr zwischenwclte are to arrange book readable display
devices for the rudder position.

Top etcktrischc rudder pointer see 'M, M H 17.

c) Hand rudder lines.

The hand-rudder line of the rudder is to lead to the emergency rudder
position in the rear compartment, which is the depth rudder from the
foreshaft shafts of the deep rudder motors to the rudder sides in the
central.

The rudder lines shall be laid with the utmost care, with the least dead
gear, as smooth lyant as possible and in such a way as to ensure the
highest degree of uniformity of the rotational movement. To avoid
inadmissible stresses due to changes in length of the pressure body
because of temperature fluctuations, enough movable couplings or glcit
sleeves shall be incorporated. Due to the waterproof and
pressure-resistant bulkheads, the shaft cables can be carried through in
stuffing bushes. Extreme noiselessness is to be aspired to. Side and
deep rudder tees shall be stored on schwingmctait. The hand rudder lines
of the deep rudders do not run with electrical operation.

The hand-rudder cable of the rudder scoops out during electrical
operation.

The drive of the deep rudder anlagc is carried out either (book electric
motors via worm gears or with hitfe of the handwheels in the centrifuge
via the rudder teites and pairs of bevel gears. By shifting a shift
lever on the gearbox, the gearbox can be adjusted to the desired drive
type. The switching from engine to manual operation can also be possible
with hitfe of a piston operated with compressed air from the control
panel.

For the side and depth rudders, the conditions for manual operation must
be chosen in such a way that a degree rudder angle with about 1.5
revolutions can be executed on the handwheel. The rotational sense of
the rudder handwheel for the rudders at the emergency rudder stand
should be such that one. Turning movement dos handwheel over top to
right leads to a removal of the submarine after the Starboard side.

For rudder engines see M, M H 1.

3. S II Group 9 Anchor device.

   a) Arrangement.

In the front toi) of the upper deck, an anchor winch, connected with
VcrholspiH, shall be incorporated for the anchor extension described in
SI21. The spin system is to be driven by an air motor, which is to be
stcllcn in the bow room, protected from moisture. In addition, a drive
must be provided by hand by means of the holspillhead, which can be set
up on the upper deck.

The switching on and off as well as the re-knocking of the air motor
must be operated by a linkage, which is to be operated from the upper
deck.

For the engine, see M, M II 2.

The chain feed between the anchor and the chain must not rest on the nut
of the anchor winch. Between the Lcitrollc and the winch is a
chain-knob, whose jaws are to be rounded off well, so that the rushing
chain does not stick. The operation of the chain knob must be set up
from the upper deck.

Transmission linkage, anchor spill.

The air motor is to be coupled with the worm corrugatof of a worm gear
by means of an elastic ruporter bolt coupling. The shaft of the worm
wheel must be placed vertically and pass through the pressure body by
means of a stuffing box. At the upper end of the worm wheel shaft, a
claw clutch must be firmly wedged. The latter is supposed to intervene
in the counter-claws of a sleeve, which sits with a spring on the lower
end of the vertical spill shaft and can be moved in and out. The sleeve
should generally always be switched on. It shall only be removed in an
emergency if the spill must be operated by the manual drive because of a
failure on the air motor from the upper deck. The rod for moving out the
sleeve is therefore only to be led to the upper deck.

A bevel gear is to be wedged onto the vertical Spillwellc, through which
the anchor winch is to be driven.

The upper end of the vertical Spillwellc is to be stored in the lower
part of the verholspill, which is to be fixed on the upper deck. The
Spillwclte is supposed to drive the spill head.

The spill head shall be connected to the vertical Spillwellc by means of
a removable coupling and formed in such a way that it can also be used
for hi-hating the anchor of Hpnd. It shall be set up for both directions
of rotation and provided with the appropriate locking jacks. The spill
head should be easily and quickly removable and can be stored in the
construction deck; in operation, it must be able to be secured against
unintentional lifting.

Further forward in the aisle, the anchor winch is to be set up under the
upper deck, which should consist of a strong boek of steel casting, in
which the shaft with the chain nut must be stored.

Between the vertical spill shaft and the chain nut wcllc, a shaft must
be placed horizontally under the upper deck. A bevel gear is to be
mounted on the rear end of the same, which is driven by the bevel wheel
on the vertical Spillwellc. A bevel gear is also to be mounted on the
front end of the horizontal shaft, which drives the bevel gear on the
chain nut wcllc.

The bevel wheel on the chain nutwelJe should run loosely and obtain
claws on one side, which intervene in the claws of a movable sleeve
attached on the chain nut wcllc with a spring. By switching on the
sleeve, the anchor winch is indented. The displacement of the mulle is
to be advertised by a rod, which can be operated from the upper deckThe
translation of the bevel gears and the screw drive are to be chosen in
such a way that the air motor runs both at a chain speed of lOm/min and
at a speed of the Vcrholtrosse of 20 m/min nüt the same normal speed of
740.

The chain nut should receive 6 teeth for the hieven of the anchor chain.
It must be provided with a) protection to prevent the chain from
jumping. A handbrake shall be connected to the nut nut, which must be
strong in such a way that, when the drive motor is disconnected, it
prevents the chain nut from turning even if the chain is stressed up to
its breaking load.

The actuation of the handbrake should be possible by means of a rod from
the upper deck.

In the upper deck, a clearly visible mechanical display device must also
be cin, which receives its drive from the horizontal chain nut shaft and
whose scale shows how many meters of chain are inserted and when the
anchor sits in the knob.

All parts of the spill ingesum shall be carried out so vigorously that
they are not yet loaded up to the flow limit in the event of a load on
the winch corresponding to the breaking load of the chain.

The outerboard shafts, on which couplings are arranged movable, are to
be made of stainless steel.

In the chain box, a clipper for the anchor chain must be installed,
which can be detached from the inside of the boat. The triggering device
must be sealed ('gl. S121).

The torpedo takeover and torpedo transport equipment will be designed
for G 7a, G 7 e and G 7's torpedoes of 53.3 cnn0' and about 7 and 7.2 m
length respectively.

For each boat, a detached torpedo crane must be delivered from the
shipyard, which is intended to take over the torpedoes from the water.

A lane bearing must be provided for the crane near the front take-over
point in the deck at Port and a lane bearing at the rear torpedo
transfer point on both sides of the board. To prove the floor for the
boom, the four lateral double bollards as well as protected receipt
lamps must be provided as required. The Geeren receive Taljen for
operation in the sea. The hot reep must be led via a foot and guide
block to the holspill.

The torpedoes should always be guided during insertion into the pressure
body, into the torpedo tubes and into the reserve bearings in such a way
that they cannot make large movements of their own when the boat moves.
For this purpose, sliding troughs, rails, etc. shall be provided in an
appropriate form and based on great safety. The transport device shall
be designed in such a way that it is also possible to store a torpedo
clay of one pipe in another pipe and to store and pick up the reserve
torpedoes.

The belts for transport ingession and straightening within the pressure
body are to be made of steel strips. The finished belts shall be subject
to a test load of 1 600 kg prior to boarding.

Special belts for quick entry must be supplied.

The loading of the torpedo tubes must be carried out with built-in
flooring and built-in berths, which are left in place and equipped with
perfect berths. The regulations for ammunition transport equipment must
be observed. For the torpedo hatches, safety crosses must be provided.

The parts for the torpedo transport as well as for the snow-loading
device shall be stored without affecting the residential equipment in
such a way that the parts required only for the fast-charging device in
their storage places do not hinder the normal torpedo transport.

For loading and unloading the upper deck containers, these must be
placed in an inclined position by means of a windmill and the torpedoes
must be inlet or retrieved.

All parts of the torpedo transport and take-over device must be

- they are made of iron, to be galvanized clean. Special attention must
be paid to smoothness of all individual parts.

Storage devices for all parts must be provided in the pressure body or
in the upper deck.

The overall equipment must be checked in detail before the boat is
delivered with model torpedoes.

The equipment described is intended to ensure that the torpedoes are
transported as quickly and safely as possible.

b) Storage of the reserve torpedoes.

In the bow torpedo room four torpedoes should be able to be stored under
the hallway, in the rear torpedo room a ' torpedo under corridor between
the E machines as a reserve.

In addition, a pressure-resistant container made of St 52 shall be
provided under upper deck aft and at the front each for the reception of
another reserve torpedo.

A storage for two more torpedoes in the bow torpedo room must be
arranged on the corridor. The storage must be divided in such a way that
the maintenance of the torpedoes under the corridor is not particularly
difficult. The fastening of the wooden lining must be immediate and
easily removable, so that after the removal of the wood lining, the
torpedoes can be pulled from tubes 3 and 4 after the additional reserve
torpedoes have been suspended.

All bearings must be provided with securely fixed and easily detachable
straps.

On the additional reserve torpedoes a loose-removable floor with a loose
small baking is to be placed.

For the storage of torpedo munitions, see S I 20.

c) Torpedo compensation devices.

Torpedo cells must be placed in the end rooms to accommodate the hull
and balancing water (see 8 I 10b). The torpedo cells are connected to
the bilge line and must be provided with vents and bearing devices (see
S II 6e, g).

For flooding of the front torpedo cells from the outboard, a flood line
is to be installed, which has a double end on the board wall and forks
after the Starboard and Port cells. A flood line for the rear torpedo
zclle must be diverted from the on-board valve for E machine cooling.

For flood lines of torpedo cells see SH 6 c.

After shooting down the torpedo and closing the muzzle flap, the pipe,
which is to be reloaded with a reserve torpedo, must be drained by
compressed air into the corresponding torpedo cell. The fittings of the
irrigation and drainage pipes of the bent pipes must be arranged in such
a way that the pipes can optionally be connected to the Starboard- and
Port-Zcllc, so that the washing water carried in the torpedo cell 2 does
not need to be used prematurely for watering the torpedo tubes.

Each of the two vent pipes of each bent pipe should be provided with a
shut-off device to achieve a complete filling of the pipes with wrapping
water even when the submarine is heavy.

The flood valves for the torpedo cells shall be arranged in such a way
that they are easily accessible from the control unit for the balancing
fitting. The flood lines for all torpedo cells are to receive quantity
counters. See S II 6c.

For air distributor, torpedo filling point and electric firing device
see M, MII4, 11 and 17.

To be able to compensate the pressure in the irrigated pipes against the
external pressure before opening the outer flaps, a connection to the
torpedo cell flood line with a further termination as a balancing line
to the torpedo tubes must be led.

The space around the rear parts of the torpedo tubes must be free of all
apparatuses and fittings which, because of their arrangement, could make
it difficult to operate the torpedo tubes.

d) Torpedo ammunition.

The box for the ignition cartridges has the perennial dimensions 270 -
240 \* 140 mm.

a) Torpedo combat pistols.

For the 9 reserve torpedoes, 9 battle pistols and 2 reserve battle
pistols are to be jammed.

The storage dimensions for battle pistol tanks must be inquired at the
T.V.A.

#. S II Group 10A Facilities for TM.

a) General.

The existing torpedo equipment should only be carried out on the
submarines to be built by the G.W. in such a way that sic can also be
used for TMA, TMB and TMC. In the preparation, account must be taken of
the experience gained so far and of the new requirements of the O.K.M.,
if any.

The submarines to be built at the other shipyards will only be set up
for torpedoes.

b) Storage and transport of the TM.

The TM shall be placed in the reserve pads prepared for the reserve
torpedoes; TM may not be accommodated in the rear compartment's spare
storage.

Intermediate bearings must be provided to allow the TM to be properly
tossed.

The hanging positions with all individual parts required for the
reassembly and replacement from the torpedo tubes must be installed.

The same requirements apply to the arrangement of the residential
equipment and the installation of the individual parts required for the
transport and storage of the TM as for torpedo armour (see S II 10a).

c) Trim and wreath pointer

Trim and acreing hands are to be installed in the control panel for
reading the longitudinal and transverse inclinations, whereas only a
trim pointer is to be installed in the tower. The measuring range of the
trim hands must be up to at least 25° pre-load

and 15° abrasion capacity, the measuring range of the ailment hands
range from 15° Starboard to 15° Port

In addition to the normal degree classification, the trim hands in the
control panel shall be given a further metre classification from which
it can be seen when the bow and the stern intersect, and by how much in
the respective trim the bow and the stern are lower or higher than the
upper edge bridge or lower edge of the keel halfway.

In particular, the following devices must be accommodated:

At the headquarters:

A water scale with plexiglass tube with a large measuring range (preload
up to 25°) as a coarse longitudinal water scale (trim pointer),

an inclination meter type Blohm & Voß as 2nd trim pointer with
meaningful display, an inclination meter type stone son as a wreath
pointer.

In the tower: an incisor type stone son as a trim pointer.

The scales of the trim and wreath hands in the control panel shall be
painted with phosphorescent, those of the trim pointer in the tower with
radioactive luminous paint

d) Wreath slot

To determine the longitudinal and transverse inclinations of the
submarine, a crane slot must also be arranged in the control center (see
Intended of the nautical instruments).

The scale shall be incorporated into a fixed light metal plate directly
below the flooring.

e) Depth gauge

For equips the submarine with simple depth gauges and Papenberg depth
gauges see M, MU 17.

The depth gauges must be arranged both in the tower and in the control
center in such a way that they can be easily seen.

The equipment must not be connected to bottom valves, pump outpours or
to places where it is possible to influence flooding or air blowing,
etc. The devices must therefore be connected to special outward-board

2. S II Group 12 facilities for diving cells, dive bunkers and flooded
   rooms

1. Furniture for diving and diving bunkers

   a) General

The attachment must be executed in the reference to the schema. Scheme
in the PORTV—V(M).

For's distribution by submersible cells and bunkers see A6f.

The flooding of the diving cells and diving bunkers is to be carried out
by opening flood flaps and venting organs. For the dive cell 1 and 5, no
flood flaps, but flood slots are to be provided. The shape of the flood
slots in the area of the screws must be chosen in such a way that no
visual-forceing noises occur!.

For flood time of the dive cells and diving bunkers see A 6 c.

For blower and blow-out equipment for the diving cells and immerses
bunkers see M, M II4 and M, M II 5

b) Flood flaps

The flood flaps shall be placed, if possible, at the lowest points of
the diving cells and immersive bunkers in such a way that the amount of
residual water remaining during the blowing out in the diving cells and
immersive bunkers becomes as small as possible.

The flood flaps of the dive cell 3 are to be formed as simple,
outward-beating flaps, which lie in a niche of the keel when the
condition is open. The flood flaps of the dive bunkers 2 and 4 should
strike inwards. The pressure must be so high that the flaps are safe to
keep tight against the water pressure acting from the outside. To
achieve a smooth ship shape, the flaps must be adapted to the shape of
the vessel if possible.

The flood flaps shall be sealed with profile ruporter made of suitable
material which must be reliably fastened. The ruporter profiles should
have the same dimensions as on the previous Type VII C submarines until
the standardization of the ruporter profiles is carried out.

On the choice of sealing ruporter see . A 3 b.

The flood flap frames shall be carried out so strongly and stiffened
against the outer skin so vigorously that work on the frames and warden
the sealing surfaces are certainly avoided.

c) Linkage

The opening and closing of the flood flaps should be done by hand, by
appropriate choice of translation without extraordinary effort. The rod
shall be calculated in such a way that no permanent changes in shape
occur at an assumed force of 100 kg on the crank.

For all moving parts of the rods inside and outside the pressure body,
including the movable nuts, a particularly good lubrication shall be
provided.

For tearing and rewinding the front flood flaps of dive cell 3, pre-gege
must be switched on. Display devices for voffenv and ?? to <t of the
flaps must be attached.

The drive spindles of the flood flaps of the diving bunker 2 are not to
pass through the inner bunkers, but niches for these rods are to be
provided. The associated stuffing bushes must be carefully packed and
made easily accessible. Drip trays shall be affixed under all stuffing
bushings of the rod seductives.

d) De-hiftations

The vents of the diving stationsHen and bunkers should preferably be
arranged at the rear end or the highest point of the diving stationsHen
or -bunker.

Diving cells 1 and 5 should each receive a vent fold. In the case of
submersible cell 1, the flap shall be attached directly to the highest
point of the submersible cell ceiling and set up inwards. Since the
ceiling drops after anum, it is ensured that the cell is well ventilated
even with greater pre-load.

The dive cell 5 is to receive an externally opening vent flap, which is
to be attached to a pipe manifold attached to a rear edge of the
submersible cell on the cell ceiling.

The immersion bunkers 2 and 4 are to receive vent pipes, namely the
pipes of diving bunker 2 Port and 4 Port to a common vent valve for both
Port bunkers at Port and those from dive bunker 2 starboard and 4
starboard to lead to another, the two Starboard-bunkers common vent
valve at Starboard.

In addition, the dive bunker 2 is to receive a residual vent valve
common for Port and Starboard. bunkers, which opens outwards, to which
vent pipes are to be led from the awvers of the bunker.

The venting of the submersible cell 3 should also be carried out
separately according to Port and Starboard. by a separate vent valve. To
connect the valve and the cell half, a pressure-resistant channel must
be carried up in the control cell skin. In addition, an additional
venting NW 40 must be provided for submersible cell 3, which must be fed
into the pressure body (central). The vent valves for diving bunkers 2
and 4 as well as for diving cell 3 should open inwards. The vent valves
must be set so high that the associated vent pipes rise steadily, so
that no air bags can be created, but the air can escape well from all
submersible cells and bunkers during annoying diving. The valves must be
protected against the falling of foreign objects by means of lattices.
All these flaps and valves must be actuated from the control panel. The
vent pipes of the immersion bunkers 2 and 4 shall also be provided with
slides and drainages that can be operated from the deck to be able to
block and drain the pipes when the immersion bunkers are driven with
drift oil. The sliders and emergency shutters as well as the pipe pieces
between them must be pressure resistant. (See S II 12g.)

The transmission rods must be led as straight as possible. The
translation and arrangement of the rods shall be chosen in such a way
that the valves and taps can be opened easily and quickly.

A particularly good lubrication of all moving parts inside and outside
the pressure body and the immersion cells and bunkers, including the
movable nuts, must be ensured.

The drives of the dive time and immersive bunker vents must be secured
by locks.

The pressurized water pipes of all outdoor bunkers and immersion bunkers
shall be secured by their position and shape within the bunker or by
special installations in such a way that at a pre- or eight-load of 20°
between water oil spiegcl and the edge determining the entry of the
propellant oil into the rising part of the pipe with complete filling of
the bunker, a water template of 1.5 v.H. of the propellant oil content
is present. However, it must be at diving bunkers of the ' water oil
picgel and thus the entry edge of the test tube 100 mm above the highest
point of upper edge of light flood flap frames. The protection against
the leakage of propellant oil shall be carried out by built-in water
boxes or, if this does not permit the shape of the outer bunker or
immersive bunker, by manifolds or double manifolds or similar measures.
A fuse against drift oil leakage is not necessary for control bunkers,
as the water pipes of the Regelbunker, even if the bunkers are filled
with propellant oil, can be blocked off because of the compressive
strength of the control bunkers.

e) Emergency shutters

For the submersible cell 3 are located at the passage points of the vent
ducts through the pressure body skin and for the immersed bunkers 2 and
4 at the confluences of the Arrange vent pipes into the bunker ceilings
emergency control valves, the actuation of which must be carried out by
hand from the inside of the pressure body. The antiicbe for the
emergency encoders must be sealed in an open position and only operated
in case of violation of the vents or when changing diving cells into

S IV Painter's Workshop.

3. S IV Group 1 Paintings.

   a) General.

In general, the choice of the painting system (painting and coating
sequence) is based on the new draft of A. B.B. No. 31, edition 41, the
"painting regulation for submarines" of Deschimag [1]_, Bremen, and the
subsequent additions, which are based on the results of the color test
programs.

The shipyards must communicate the painting systems which they choose
for the exterior paints above and under water and the interior paints
and the changes that occur therein to the O.K.M.

Since the protective effect of the coatings depends on the careful
cleaning of the painting base and the conscientious execution of the
base coat as well as on the good drying of the paints, each individual
painting must be completely dried through before a new coat may be
applied to it. Special care must be taken to the good ventilation of the
rooms.

Special requirements for the colors of individual rooms, etc., see S IV
1b.

b) Special Coatings

To save the savings materials used to produce the previously used and
1t. During the war, the battery compartments will only have to be
painted in the lower part, in the exposed pressure body skin up to the
edge plates of the lateral fuel oil bunkers, with the acid protection
inks provided for in **A.B.B. No. 31** The paint with acid protection
paints must be pulled up a little over the connection points of the
drift oil bunker edge plates. The end bulkheads of the battery
compartments shall also be painted up to the same height from below with
these acid protective colors; the same coating should continue to be
given to the accumulator foundations (scaffolds).

The part of the battery compartments above the specified area (vertical
drift oil bunker wall, upper part of the end bulkhead, battery ceiling,
etc.) is triple with acid protection paint according to War- **A.B.B.
No. 31 Edition No. 41** A good overlap of the two types of paint must be
ensured.

     #. S IV Group 2 Cementing.

        a) General

Cementing shall be carried out as little as possible. In watertight
rooms in the outer aisle and in the dive spires, which are not set up as
diving bunkers, corners from which the rcst water cannot be directed to
the drain scointers are to be fidgeted with bitumastic. The filling
should extend to the outlet opening of the flood valves or to the mouth
of the residual water pipes. The rooms in the diving cells and immersive
bunkers below the flood flaps, in which residual water remains after
blowing out, are not to be filled.

In the pressure body, all areas in which residual water can remain
standing shall also be filled with bitumastic to so far that the water
can flow completely into the adjacent bilge.

Both toilet dreams are to be given cement flooring, which is to be
succumbed with gradients after the spear.
